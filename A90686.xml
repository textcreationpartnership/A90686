            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We the unworthie≈øt of the ≈øervants of Chri≈øt, having with many others, long waited for the practice of Reformation in the Parochial Congregations of this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119878:7"/>Nation (as the fruit of the prayers, tears and bloud of the Lords people.) And though there have been expedients held forth, yet finding they lay dead upon the ≈øpirits of too many, it plea≈øed the Lord to ≈øtirre us up, though the la≈øt and lea≈øt of our Brethren, to enquire after him in this matter, labouring (as far as we were able) to lay a≈øide all prejudices and prepo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, as to the different wayes were held forth by holy men in the Nation, and ≈øo to pur≈øue in the Lords ≈øtrength what he ≈øhould plea≈øe to clear unto us to be his will, and to impre≈øs upon our hearts, and accordingly to practi≈øe it: Upon this we betook our ≈øelves to publick Humiliation in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting and Prayer in our re≈øpective places, as al≈øo to private weekly ≈øeeking the Lord together, and conference, in which duties we found the Lord greatly aba≈øing our ≈øpirits before him, for the great neglects which had been upon u as to this duty, and we were even afraid to plead with our God, con≈øidering how greatly we had failed, and put off the work of Reformation from our ≈øpirits, and the many ≈øore and great evils the Lord was pleas'd to di≈øcover
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119878:7"/>upon our hearts, ≈øpecially that great ≈ønare (which we de≈øire with all humility to declare to the prai≈øe of God, and the admonition of our Brethren) in which we had been long held, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That reforming our Congregations could not be attain'd, but by a Law from the Supream Magi≈øtrate, thereby exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating our ≈øelves of the duties the Lord required from us, and the laying the guilt at their door, which the Lord hath now ≈øhew'd us to be a very ≈øhift; and we con≈øider 'tis a great mercy that we have protection from the Magi≈øtrate in the peaceable practice of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are convine'd and finde that 'tis the power of the Go≈øpel, the Spirit working by it, that is the only expedient to bring a people to a more clo≈øe and holy fellow≈øhip together, by their willing and mutual ≈øubjection to the rule of the Lord Je≈øus over them; We take it to be derogatory from him, for a people to be forc'd by humane power into the full fellow≈øhip of the Church; ≈øutable to the≈øe convincements, we endeavour'd to clear unto our people, the nature of Church-fellow≈øhip, and the way of it,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119878:8"/>and the nece≈ø≈øity of Di≈øcipline, and ≈øo to call upon them to joyn with us in the Lords work, that we might <hi>give up our ≈øelves unto him, in a profe≈ø≈øed ≈øubjection to the Go≈øpel, and to grow to a more clo≈øe fellow≈øhip together, that all Ordinances might be duly admini≈øtred, to the honour of Chri≈øt, and that formality and luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmne≈øs might be in ≈øome mea≈øure broken.</hi> Accordingly an Expedient or Profe≈ø≈øion was drawn up, wherein we acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our former abominations in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip, and profe≈ø≈øing our Repentance before the Lord for them, do ≈øolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enter into, and renew our Covenant with God, that he may be our God, and we his people, to own the Lord Je≈øus in his Offices, to ≈øubmit to godly Order and Di≈øcipline, to watch over one another, to walk in mutual edification, knit together in love, and ≈øo receiving others as the Lord ≈øhall over-power their hearts, ≈øome account of them≈øelves being given, and no ju≈øt exception (in a charitable judgement) to be made again≈øt them; This being the known duty of every compleat member in a particular Church, as in effect granted by both the godly parties, we conceived
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119878:8"/>few or none who were for purity would ≈øtick at it, the want of which practice we take to be the main rea≈øon of ≈øuch great corruptions in the mixt Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which corruptions, we humbly conceive, do put us inevitably upon this practice, if Reformation be <hi>really</hi> effected; That the ≈øub≈øtance of this is practi≈øed by the Presbyterian Brethren, though differing in the expedient, is ≈øufficiently clear by the practice of the <hi>London</hi> Presbytery, who call upon all, and receive ≈øuch as freely tender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, and require an account of them, waiting for the coming in of the re≈øt, which are much the greater party in mo≈øt Pari≈øhes, without Excommunicating ≈øuch as refu≈øe upon what account ≈øoever, to our be≈øt information, and ≈øo the <hi>minor</hi> party do withdraw from the greater, which the corruption of the greater part (in their enmity to Reformation) doth put them and us upon, unle≈øs we will content our ≈øelves with the ≈øetting up a meer form of Di≈øcipline, but indeed ≈øit down again on the fame lees of formality, which the Lord hath in ≈øore judgements ≈øo much witne≈ø≈øed again≈øt, and his ≈øoul abhorreth. To take the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119878:9"/>boldne≈øs of a word more, as to our godly Brethren: We humbly conceive, that if that our Principle agreed upon by the mo≈øt of the different wayes (<hi>viz.</hi> That every particular Congregation hath power to reform it ≈øelf, and ≈øo Mini≈øters to be helpfull to each other in it) were <hi>really</hi> practis'd; the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie of Appeals would quickly cea≈øe. And further (which is al≈øo on both hands granted) that an A≈ø≈øembly of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of ≈øeveral Churches in the Name of Chri≈øt, is an Ordinance of Chri≈øt for the healing of differences, the conte≈øt, Whether this power ≈øhall be ≈øtiled <hi>Juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical</hi> or <hi>Declarative,</hi> and whether this A≈ø≈øembly ≈øhould actually excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or declare the fact to be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable, would ≈øurely cea≈øe: It is very ≈øad that a controver≈øie about Appeals, which happily in well-order'd Churches, may rarely be needfull, ≈øhould hinder us in the practice of the fir≈øt Principles which all agree in for the ≈øub≈øtance of them, and ≈øhould make us draw har≈øh con≈øequences from one anothers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øes, which both di≈øavow, and ≈øo lay ≈øtumbling blocks in the wayes of the weak, and hinder the hoped ≈øucce≈øs of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119878:9"/>the Go≈øpel and Reformation in the Nation: Let us fir≈øt have our Churches form'd up and order'd according to Go≈øpel-rules, the ignorant and profane withdrawn from (≈øince 'tis clear they cannot be regularly ca≈øt out by Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline) and then the way of tho≈øe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches holding Communion together, would naturally fall in: To this practice (by the good hand of the Lord) we have mutually given up our ≈øelves, and engaged in the Lord to be helpfull to each other, and to hold Communion together, and a day of ≈ømall things is wit us, yea we have had very precious te≈øtimonies of the Lords pre≈øence with it, with ≈øome of us, for which we ble≈øs him, and our eyes are upon him to bring his own work to pa≈øs, <hi>who is able to work and none ≈øhall let it,</hi> I≈øa. 43.13.</p>
            <p>The good Lord pardon us, if we are not clean≈øed according to the purifying of the Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>We ≈øhall yet for further ≈øatisfaction, briefly give an an≈øwer to the mo≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon objections to, and mi≈øunder≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our practice.</p>
            <p>It is enquired in what relation do we conceive our ≈øelves to ≈øtand unto the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119878:10"/>re≈øt, and how doe we e≈øteem of them?</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the weak (but not ob≈øtinate) that have not ≈øtrength enough to come up to this practice, we conceive it the Mini≈øters duty to labour their convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in publick and private, and the united Brethren to do their duty, by praying for them, and to labour to draw them on to them, by all good wayes and means, and not to neglect them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ≈øuch as <hi>peremptorily</hi> deny to ≈øubject to Chri≈øts Di≈øcipline, upon indeed a profane account, they doe virtually excommunicate them≈øelves (at lea≈øt from that particular Church) for being called upon to walk with them in the ≈øubjection and fellow≈øhip of the Go≈øpel, they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refu≈øe ≈øo to do, but will continue in that loo≈øe e≈øtate, and though they were baptized, yet by their refu≈øing to ≈øubject to Chri≈øt, they are as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>r≈øin</hi> ≈øpeaks <hi>Deficientes √† ≈øuo Bapti≈ømo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. de di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cip &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com.</note> ≈øuch as for the pre≈øent make void the fruit of their Bapti≈øm (though if they are after called we do not a≈ø≈øert a nece≈ø≈øity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing it) and to admit ≈øuch to the Lords Supper, were, as that acute Author ju≈øtly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119878:10"/>≈øaith, and is evident from the Word, to confound and make one the Church of Chri≈øt and the Kingdom of the devil, as we ≈øhall (God willing) demon≈øtrate in this Di≈øcour≈øe; and though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to profe≈ø≈øe and know God, yet <hi>factis negant foedus Dei,</hi> they deny him and his Covenant in their works and lives,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.16.</note> and ≈øo ought not to be admitted to the Seals of it.</p>
            <p>So that ≈øuch per≈øons refu≈øing to own the Covenant of God into which they were tendered in Bapti≈øm, Je≈øus Chri≈øt in his Offices and Di≈øcipline, and the fellow≈øhip of that particular Church, whereof he pretends to be a Member, being called thereunto, or by their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and profanene≈ø≈øe not fit to be received; what need any formal act of Excommunication pa≈ø≈øe upon them?</p>
            <p>Specially fir≈øt, Since there was never any ≈øuch former orderly receiving them into the compleat Communion of the Church upon their <hi>profe≈ø≈øed faith and obedience before the Church,</hi> nor did ever give their con≈øents to ≈øubmit to Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Neither is there any way how they ≈øhould be rightly excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119878:11"/>for that the <hi>major</hi> part of the Church is corrupt (which we may well ≈øuppo≈øe in mo≈øt of the mixt Parothial Congregations in <hi>England</hi>) and ≈øo will not excommunicate, nor are fit to do ≈øo, nor fit to choo≈øe Officers to do it.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides, as we have formerly hinted, we never heard that either the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian or Congregational Brethren do excommunicate ≈øuch as ≈øubmit not; and therefore we rather wonder the more why this ≈øhould be kept up as a note of difference between them, when practice confutes it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is objected, that we propo≈øe a <hi>Covenant:</hi> we an≈øwer for the ≈øatisfaction of any, that we propo≈øe the Covenant e≈øtabli≈øht in Chri≈øt Je≈øus; The profe≈ø≈øing to enter into which, we in≈øi≈øt upon in order to a per≈øons partaking the ≈øeal of it; and tho≈øe who require profe≈ø≈øion of repentance and faith in Chri≈øt before the Presbytery do, in ≈øub≈øtance the ≈øame thing; for Knowledge, Faith, and Obedience are the graces of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is mo≈øt evident that Faith and Repentance in Chri≈øts and the Apo≈øtles time were expected and required to be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119878:11"/>profe≈ø≈øed from the per≈øon to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis manife≈øt that back≈øliders from this profe≈ø≈øion were not to be admitted to further Communion, as <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus;</hi> And that tho≈øe who brake bread, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. <hi>continued in the Apostles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and fellow≈øhip.</hi> It is al≈øo evident that in the pure≈øt times the Sacrament of Bapti≈øm was admini≈øtred to the party entring into Covenant, <hi>Credis?

Plainly, it will then follow, that it is the duty of tho≈øe who are baptized in Infancy, after they have gladly heard and received the Word, to own, profe≈øs and enter into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God into which they were ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in Bapti≈øm, and to joyn them≈øelves by a free expre≈ø≈øed con≈øent, to the Communion of the Church, that ≈øo they may <hi>continue</hi> in the <hi>Apo≈øtles doctrine and fellow≈øhip, and breaking of bread,</hi> &amp;c. This was appointed to be the practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, to require this, and ≈øo none to be e≈øteemed in the <hi>compleat Communion</hi> of the Church without it,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119878:12"/>and therefore not to be admitted to the Lords Supper, till ≈øuch a <hi>covenanting, ≈øubmitting</hi> and <hi>joyning:</hi> We finde holy <hi>Bucer</hi> much lamenting the want of this practice, in an Epi≈øtle to <hi>Calvin, <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>tinam, ficut i≈øtud foedus civile, h√¨c aliquando redintegra≈ø≈øemus &amp; ≈øanxi≈ø≈øemus foedus vitae aeternae, quomodo vos conati ≈øoli prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtiti≈øtis;</hi>

               <q>Oh that we had renew'd and e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øht the Covenant of eternal life, as we have done a civil Covenant.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119878:12"/>and that they re≈øtore Di≈øcipline among them≈øelves. There are ≈øome of all orders who are again≈øt the re≈øtoring of ≈øolid fellow≈øhip and Di≈øcipline.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now as that which is ≈øtyl'd a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Covenant, ≈øo much debated among the godly, we take it to be no more, then ≈øuch a <hi>mutual agreement</hi> and <hi>joyning</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether mention'd, that <hi>≈øolid fellow≈øhip and Di≈øcipline may be ≈øet up,</hi> el≈øe how can there be an unity and fellow-member≈øhip in a particular Church?</p>
            <p>Say ≈øuch even who di≈øpute again≈øt this practice, This is imply'd in the very principles of Chri≈øtianity; We then apprehend it is not unlawfully but indeed nece≈ø≈øary, expre≈øly to profe≈øs what flows from the principles of it; ≈øpecially in this ca≈øe, where 'tis a mans own free act that con≈øtitutes him a member of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church.</p>
            <p>Such a <hi>Profe≈ø≈øion</hi> and <hi>expre≈øs con≈øent</hi> to walk in fellow≈øhip, and to ≈øubmit to Di≈øcipline, we call for; and we believe without it it will hardly be ≈øet up, unle≈øs a catechi≈øtical an≈øwer or two of a per≈øon examin'd (though never ≈øo dead-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a clo≈øe enemy to the power of godline≈øs) ≈øhall be thought enough,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119878:13"/>which will be to ≈øettle again where we were, in old ignorance, lukewarmne≈øs, loo≈øne≈øs and formality; in ≈øtead of ≈øuch as fear the Lord, walking in fellow≈øhip with the Father, and one with another in the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Now that any that truly fear the Lord ≈øhould ≈øtick at this, <hi>viz.</hi> to profe≈øs to own the Covenant of Gods free grace, to give up them≈øelves unto it, and to Je≈øus Chri≈øt the Mediatour of it in all his Offices, to walk under his Di≈øcipline, and in fellow≈øhip with his people, we cannot but ju≈øtly wonder, and why any godly men of parts ≈øhould frame and rai≈øe up bug-bears again≈øt it; The Lord give them to beleeve, yea to ta≈øte the goodne≈øs and ≈øweetne≈øs of it, and they will be humbled before the Lord that they ever with≈øtood it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Novelty of this practice, and from keeping any from the Sacrament, is objected to us and others.</p>

               <hi>Humfreys,</hi> aiming at the ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the people meerly; conceiving that judicious godly Mini≈øters are not at all ≈øtartled in their principles by what he hath vented; And ≈øo we have laboured to frame ≈øuch an≈øwers as are mo≈øt obvious to the people, and not puzzle them.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, We take notice of this Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the≈øis in the Title, viz. <hi>That his Treati≈øe was publi≈øhed for the ea≈øe, ≈øupport and ≈øatisfaction of tender con≈øciences (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe remedile≈ø≈øe) in or mixt Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> 1. By <hi>ea≈øe,</hi> it is plain he means by his Sophi≈øtry to delude their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtandings ≈øo far as that they may without ≈øcruple partake of the Lords Table with the ignorant and profane; This is to make the con≈øcience <hi>quiet,</hi> and not <hi>good;</hi> as water cooling a feaver for the pre≈øent, but makes it return with greater vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are confident this hath not <hi>ea≈øed,</hi> but more <hi>grieved</hi> and <hi>perplexed,</hi> the mo≈øt <hi>tender coh≈øciences</hi> in the Natton,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119878:16"/>as mo≈øt of the godly bear witne≈øs, and hath made the hearts of the righteous ≈øad; The burden of ≈øuch mixt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating, which hath been and is in the mixt Congregations of <hi>England,</hi> hath been and is the grief and ≈øad complaint of the ≈øervants of God both Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters and people, and will be proved a ≈ønare.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whereas he ≈øaith, <hi>Tender con≈øciences are otherwi≈øe remedile≈øs in our mixt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. We offer it to con≈øideration, Whether he doth not imply that our Congregations ought not to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ≈øo mixt with all manner of profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and ignorance, as the mo≈øt are? And whether he doth not propo≈øe this as ≈øatisfaction to tender con≈øciences onely in this exigency of time, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth no other remedy is to be had for want of a Di≈øcipline e≈øtabli≈øht, and Elder'd Congregations, as he intimates in the clo≈øe, and as he alloweth of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication all along his book, and ≈øo his arguments to ≈øatisfie tender con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in ≈øuch an exigency, imply, that other <hi>remedies</hi> are de≈øirable, and to be lookt after.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:119878:16"/>
            <p n="2">2. But we conceive and know, that tender con≈øciences are not otherwi≈øe <hi>remedile≈øs,</hi> if they do not ≈øubmit to ≈øuch a mixt Communion, we apprehend <hi>the remedy</hi> laid down in the Preamble to be <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> and what others are pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd by godly men in the Nation: Surely this evil is not ≈øo <hi>remedile≈øs,</hi> if godly Mini≈øters and people will do their duty. We de≈øire with all ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to remark, that many do hotly di≈øpute again≈øt <hi>Erastiani≈øm,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Of Church-power being in the Magistrate,</hi> and yet they ≈øay Di≈øcipline cannot be practi≈øed without a Law from them (though they will protect men peaceably doing their duty) which we look upon as a very ≈ønare upon the ≈øpirits of good men. Therefore (ble≈ø≈øed be God) there are comfortable remedies, if applied, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wallowing back again into that ≈øea of dead bloud, that corrupt, carnal, dead-hearted, formal, prophane, ignorant practice of wor≈øhip we have been in.</p>
            <p>We cannot but likewi≈øe take notice of an expre≈ø≈øion in the Epi≈øtle to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as it ≈øeems penn'd by another, wherein he cals this practice of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admi≈ø≈øion, <hi>precious light;</hi> We are ≈øure
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119878:17"/>it hath by the holy people of this and other Nations, been ever accounted <hi>gro≈øs darkne≈øs,</hi> born witne≈øs again≈øt by mo≈øt of the Confe≈ø≈øions and Martyrs in all ages of the Church, yea hi≈øt at as a <hi>profane principle,</hi> and hath ≈øent many of as eminent Saints as ever this Nation was ble≈øt with, to pri≈øons and bani≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Oh horrid! that the liberty of all ungodly per≈øons, promi≈øcuou≈øly to profane the holy things of God, ≈øhould now be ≈øtiled <hi>precious light!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to take notice and examine how <hi>precious</hi> it is, yet with all due re≈øpect to the Author.</p>
            <p>His Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.27. <hi>They all drank of it: All the twelve without exception; from whence,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>I gather free Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> 1. But we are bold to ≈øay mo≈øt incon≈øequently, as ever was Argument drawn by a man of parts. Ju≈øt the contrary will be thus argued, There were but only twelve Apo≈øtles (though Chri≈øt had many other followers and hearers) admitted by Chri≈øt to his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, therefore all of all ≈øorts were not admitted to come; this is ≈øure more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourably argued.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:119878:17"/>
            <p n="2">2. Becau≈øe onely twelve Apo≈øtles, none being under ≈øcandal or ignorance, brake bread with Chri≈øt, therefore <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, ≈øwearers, liars, drunkards, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean per≈øons, covetous, revilers and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of godly Preachers and people,</hi> ≈øuch as mo≈øt Congregations, to ≈øpeak out, do abound with, may now come to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Communion of Saints.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is the force of his Argument, Chri≈øt took twelve with him, and all tho≈øe twelve drank of the Cup, therefore all might have come that would. Twelve Aldermen are invited by a Major to a fea≈øt, and becau≈øe <hi>all</hi> the twelve eat, therefore all the beggars of the Town might have come.</p>
            <p>If the ≈øtre≈øs of his Argument lie in <hi>Judas</hi> his partaking of it, he might have been pleas'd ≈øo to have urg'd it, and not put ≈øuch a fallacy upon weak people:</p>
            <p>And if it do, we an≈øwer briefly here, (and more fully where he plainly ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it) that it was irrational <hi>Judas</hi> ≈øhould have been kept off before he had committed the ≈øcandal, ≈øpecially Chri≈øt acting in that as an ordinary Mini≈øter and Pa≈øt our to his Church.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:119878:18"/>
            <p>In his ≈øtating the Que≈øtion, he a≈ø≈øerts, <hi>All in the vi≈øible Church are capable of all Ordinances, but Infants, di≈øtracted per≈øons, and excommunicated per≈øons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Let the Reader ob≈øerve, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Humfreys</hi> allows Excommunication: of whom? of ≈øuch as are detected for ≈øcandal, or unduly admitted into the Church formerly, being gro≈øly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; How will free Admi≈ø≈øion and Excommunication ≈øtand together? If it be every mans duty to come, why ≈øhould any hinder him?</p>
            <p>But ≈øaith he, <hi>unle≈øs excommunicated:</hi> But what if they are <hi>excommunicable?</hi> Doth not that Pa≈øtour and Church ≈øinne before the Lord if they do not excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them? If the greater part be ≈øuch, ought not the Pa≈øtour and ≈øuch as fear God with him (due means having been u≈øed for the conviction of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, ≈øuper≈øtitious and ≈øcandalous) to withdraw from them, in the exerci≈øe of this Ordinance, if Di≈øcipline cannot otherwi≈øe be taken up, as in a corrupt majority how can it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 3. ≈øaith he, <hi>Though he que≈øtions the capacity of many people, becau≈øe a ≈øolemn preparation is required, yet he ≈øaith,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119878:18"/>he humbly per≈øwades him≈øelf that for the Ministers and Churches part as to offering Chri≈øt freely, there is ≈øuch an univer≈øal capacity, that if any come in profe≈ø≈øing them≈øelves ready to enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Chri≈øt, and ≈øerve him in this Ordinance, we may encourage him, from Rev.</hi> 22.17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Here is the fallacy couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that runnes thorow the whole Book.</p>
            <p>But is not this a ≈øad confounding of things?</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is mo≈øt true, that ≈øinners are freely to be invited to Chri≈øt? But mu≈øt it be pre≈øently to this Ordinance of the Supper? If they do indeed profe≈øs them≈øelves ready to enter into Covenant with Chri≈øt, and their lives do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict this covenanting, the Church is to receive them, but ought not this to be an <hi>explicit</hi> profe≈ø≈øion to the Church or Officers of it? Mu≈øt a profane per≈øon ru≈øhing upon the ordinance as formerly, be ≈øuppo≈øed to do ≈øo, <hi>meerly</hi> becau≈øe he comes? Upon this ≈øcore, who ever they be, Turks, Pagans, Jews, if they hear a Sermon, and come and eat and drink at the Supper, it is to be ≈øuppo≈øed they do
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119878:19"/>implicitely enter into Covenant with Chri≈øt; how ab≈øurd would this be, and makes the bloud of the Covenant an unclean thing?</p>
            <p>But ≈øecondly, <hi>his humble per≈øwa≈øion</hi> is not argument enough to prove, that the Mini≈øter and Church is to be ≈øo <hi>remi≈øs</hi> and <hi>≈ølight</hi> in this matter, without a former profe≈ø≈øion before the Lord and the Church, of every per≈øons willingne≈øs to covenant with Chri≈øt, and ≈øubmit to Di≈øcipline, (e≈øpecially in this lap≈øed ≈øtate we now are in) and the Church in a judgement of charity ≈øatisfied in them; if he means ≈øuch a precedent, explicite, open profe≈ø≈øion of every per≈øon, we agree with him; but unle≈øs his Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation be the Phoenix of all in <hi>England,</hi> I beleeve he would have but a few Communicants upon ≈øuch an account, as trial hath been made by many godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters in this particular.</p>
            <p>But as we have ≈øaid, if he mean his meer coming, is ≈øuch a profe≈ø≈øion, we take it to be very delu≈øory, indeed a very mocking of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Humfreys</hi> well knows how unduly all ≈øorts have been admitted to the Communion of the Church former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119878:19"/>and therefore now in times of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation the ca≈øe is di≈øtant; how few, alas to be found that know or have been ever truly taught what it is to covenant with Chri≈øt?</p>
            <p>This ≈øtrange latitude that this latter ≈øen≈øe implies, is farre from the Churches ≈øtrictne≈øs in the pure≈øt times, in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting their <hi>Catechumeni</hi> into the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low≈øhip of the Church.</p>
            <p>He goes on, <hi>Pag.</hi> 4. <hi>That he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves none unle≈øs excommunicated</hi> (ip≈øo jure, <hi>or</hi> facto) <hi>ought to be refu≈øed, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he means by <hi>excommunicated, ip≈øo jure,</hi> ≈øuch as of <hi>right</hi> ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by the Church, then the matter is ended; for it is mo≈øt true, that none but ≈øuch as are already excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, are to be kept from the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ≈øuch without que≈øtion ought to be kept off, and if ≈øo, he grants what we de≈øire.</p>
            <p>But let us examine his further <hi>proofs</hi> for <hi>free Admi≈ø≈øion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His fir≈øt Scripture is from <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>There was free admi≈ø≈øion to the Pa≈ø≈øeover, therefore to the Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:119878:20"/>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> 1. If all came to the Pa≈ø≈øeover, then there was no Excommunication in the Jewi≈øh Church, which Scripture <hi>Era≈øtus</hi> and his followers u≈øe to prove there was none; And by this argument he will make void Excommunication now, (which as he hath ≈øtated the matter, will not be well con≈øi≈øtent with his free Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion.) All to come to the Lords Supper, as all did come to the Pa≈ø≈øeover, none kept back from the one, therefore none from the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But we deny that all were admitted to the Pa≈ø≈øeover; he confe≈ø≈øeth him≈øelf, from <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. that they were to be kept off for a moneth, for legal polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which was a type of ≈øinne) ≈øuppo≈øing that they ≈øhould clean≈øe them≈øelves in that moneth, otherwi≈øe they were longer to be kept off, as will nece≈ø≈øarily follow, the end of their keeping off for that time, being that they ≈øhould be clean≈øed, as <hi>Pareus,</hi> and others upon the place well ob≈øerve.</p>
            <p>We cannot here in≈øi≈øt to enforce the many Scriptures and Arguments which have been brought by others, to prove that the Jews were kept from the Pa≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over both for legal and moral unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119878:20"/>for ≈øcandalous ≈øins, which we are confident neither he nor all the world will be able to an≈øwer: Therefore we do indeed the more wonder that he will urge this, and go about to impo≈øe it on Mini≈øters and people, ≈øo ≈ølightly pa≈ø≈øing over what ≈øo many learned and godly men have wrote, ≈øpecially the <hi>London</hi> Mini≈øters, and <hi>Scotch</hi> Divines, and not take notice of their weighty argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>But we will clear it from the Scriptures plainly. See, <hi>Reader,</hi> Numb. 15.30, 31. &amp; Chap. 19. <hi>That there was a cutting off from the Congregation ≈øuch as did ought pre≈øumptuou≈øly again≈øt the Lord, that de≈øpi≈øed the word of the Lord, that tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øed the Sabbath.</hi> So <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.8. <hi>Who≈øoever would not come to build the Temple within the three dayes, ≈øhould be ≈øeparated from the Congregation.</hi> And <hi>who≈øoever ≈øhould confe≈øs Chri≈øt was to be put out of the Synagogue,</hi> John 9.22. Yea him≈øelf grants, that the Jews had their ≈øeveral degrees of Excommunication, <hi>p.</hi> 84. of his Book. And is not the neglect of keeping of the profane from the holy things charg'd upon the Prie≈øts as a great evil? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.26. <hi>Her Prie≈øts have
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119878:21"/>violated my Law, and have profaned my holy things, they have put no difference between the holy and profane,</hi> &amp;c. Yea further, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44 7, 9. <hi>The uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed in heart were not to enter into the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary to pollute it,</hi> that is, ≈øuch as did manife≈øtly in their lives appear to be ≈øo, though they had received outward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumci≈øion. And the Lord ≈øaith, <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 13. <hi>That ≈øuch of the Prie≈øts that thus tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øed the Covenant of the Lord ≈øhould bear their iniquity, and they ≈øhould not come near unto him to do the Office of a Prie≈øt any more.</hi> This al≈øo is typical of the ≈øpiritual Sanctuary the Church of Chri≈øt in Go≈øpel times.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ≈øaid, it will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øily appear, without troubling the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with any more, that the Jews were kept off from the Pa≈ø≈øeover for pre≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous and ≈øcandalous ≈øins; for if they were cut off from the Congregation, then they came not at the Pa≈ø≈øeover; and one end of their cutting off was, that they might not defile the Pa≈ø≈øeover, as hath been proved; Therefore, Reader, thus farre it appears M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Humfreys</hi> hath deluded thee.</p>
            <p>His next Scripture is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.7. <hi>We
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119878:21"/>being many are all partakers of one bread, All at Corinth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> True, All ≈øuch who <hi>joyned them≈øelves</hi> to the Church by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apo≈øtles did ≈øo, who came and profe≈ø≈øed ≈øubjection to the Lord Chri≈øt and his Go≈øpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. and <hi>became a cha≈øte Spou≈øe unto Chri≈øt,</hi> Chap. 11.2. the≈øe did all partake it. But, Sir, were the Parochial Churches in <hi>England</hi> (though we deny them not to be Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in a large ≈øen≈øe) ≈øo brought in? Will you compare the ob≈øtinate igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this age of people, to <hi>profe≈ø≈øing Saints at Corinth?</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øtyleth, <hi>Called to be Saints, and ≈øanctified in Chri≈øt Je≈øus,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.2. as we ≈øhall el≈øwhere urge.</p>
            <p>Are not zealous Preachers of the Go≈øpel, upon laying a≈øide corrupt forms, and ≈øuper≈øtitious u≈øages in too many places, de≈øpi≈øed and reviled by the mo≈øt, as Novelli≈øts and Troublers of <hi>I≈ørael?</hi> would, do you imagine, <hi>Paul</hi> write to ≈øuch as Saints and ≈øanctified, and ≈øtile the Churches the cha≈øte Spou≈øes of Chri≈øt, where ≈øo much abetted profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and affected ignorance?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be≈øides the Apo≈øtles drift in that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119878:22"/>place is not to prove that <hi>all</hi> did partake of the bread, but that tho≈øe that <hi>did</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, were <hi>one bread</hi> together, and therefore they ≈øhould flie idolatrous ≈øea≈øts, le≈øt they were made <hi>one body</hi> with them, by eating with them.</p>

               <hi>Pag.</hi> 6. But faith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Humfreys, Many of the≈øe Corinths were ready to go to their Idols, and to commit Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw,</hi> It ≈øeems then they were but <hi>ready</hi> to go to their Idols, they did not <hi>actually</hi> commit Idolatry. The truth is this, ≈øome of them through weakne≈øs, did eat at their fea≈øts, of meats ≈øacrificed to Idols, which things the Apo≈øtle ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely warns them of, le≈øt they ≈øhould be tempted back to Idolatry, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Jews, and the Lords judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them; not as if the≈øe <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths</hi> did already commit Idolatry, but he warns them again≈øt it, and ≈øo in the clo≈øe of the Chapter ≈øtates the eating of tho≈øe meats, in it ≈øelf an indifferent action, ≈øo the ≈ønare to Idolatry be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and offence to the weak brother; which Interpretation is given by all ≈øound Interpreters we meet with.</p>
            <p>Now to ≈øtile the <hi>Corinths</hi> lukewarm Chri≈øtians. as indifferent to Chri≈øtianity
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119878:22"/>or Idolatry, and ≈øo to ju≈øtifie the Admi≈ø≈øion of ≈øuch to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, is more then this Scripture will allow.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By this Argument al≈øo he would prove, that ≈øuch as are actual Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may be admitted to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is free Admi≈ø≈øion to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe.</p>

The≈øe <hi>Corinths</hi> being newly come out of Idolatry, as hath been ≈øhew'd, did in imitation of the idolatrous ≈øea≈øts keep their <hi>love fea≈øts,</hi> Jude ver. 12. when they came to the Lords Supper.

            <p>Reader ob≈øerve, that by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in perverting the≈øe Scriptures, he pleads for impenitent Idolaters and drunkards to come to the Sacrament; Hath not this man a great care of the the Lords wor≈øhip?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It doth not appear, that this was an ob≈øtinate, con≈øtant practice of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths,</hi> but a <hi>weakne≈øs,</hi> they being newly come out of their Heatheni≈øm.</p>

               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Upon this di≈øtinction we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume the Author took up this judgment; we ≈øhall further ≈øpeak to it, where he more at large urgeth it.</p>
            <p>For pre≈øent, we deny there is any <hi>ab≈øolute</hi> command of coming to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, unle≈øs ≈øo qualified, as the word of God requires; <hi>worthine≈øs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very formality of their coming. There's a double <hi>worthine≈øs, Real,</hi> the ≈øanctification of the per≈øon, without this no particular per≈øon ought to come
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119878:23"/>(at lea≈øt begun upon him) <hi>for he eats and drinks damnation without it; And let a man examine him≈øelf, and ≈øo let him eat, ≈øo,</hi> and not otherwi≈øe, without his exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination he ought not to come; this as to his own con≈øcience.</p>
            <p>Will not M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Humfreys</hi> preach thus, Unle≈øs you examine your <hi>≈øelves,</hi> that is, as to your repentance and faith, you ought not to come to this holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? Or will he ≈øay thus, Though you do not, yet you ought to come, that's your duty? For, ≈øaith the Author, <hi>Nothing is or could be ≈øaid again≈øt their coming:</hi> Nothing?<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.27, 29, 30.</note> Is <hi>eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judgement to them≈øelves</hi> nothing? Be <hi>≈øtricken with ≈øickne≈øs, weakne≈øs, death,</hi> Is this nothing? But he will ≈øay, This was for their unworthine≈øs; therefore they ought not to come, being under ≈øuch unworthine≈øs. If a Ma≈øter enjoyn his ≈øervant not to come into his pre≈øence, unle≈øs ≈øo and ≈øo habited upon pain of death; ≈øhall that per≈øon yet go, becau≈øe he will ≈øay, he ought to go to his Ma≈øter, 'tis his duty? So ≈øaith the Lord Chri≈øt by <hi>Paul,</hi> He that comes to me in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of my la≈øt Supper, ought to come with ≈øuch and ≈øuch a worthine≈øs, or he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119878:24"/>incurs death and judgement without his repentance: Now will that per≈øon ≈øay, or will any ≈øay to him, 'Tis your duty however to come? Nay, Is it not their duty to ab≈øtain? 'Tis his duty indeed to examine and prepare him≈øelf, and ≈øo to come, but 'tis not his duty to come, if unworthine≈øs be upon him: 'Tis true, there is an indefinite mediate obligation of all fle≈øh to obey God the Creatour in every command of his, and 'tis their ≈øinne and condemnation in failing, but there are ≈øome duties of his wor≈øhip, wherein he hath appointed that his Name ≈øhall be thus and thus ≈øanctified by his own people, and to approach him in the≈øe without it, is a greater ≈øin then to ab≈øtain from them, e≈øpecially in this Ordinance. So much for real worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, There is <hi>vi≈øible worthine≈øs.</hi> in reference to the Church; and this the Church is to look to, in order to the right honouring of the name of God in his wor≈øhip, and its own purity. Now <hi>Paul</hi> in this Chapter doth only admoni≈øh the <hi>Corinths,</hi> and convince them, and ≈øo ≈øeems to hope their amendment in the two la≈øt ver≈øes of the Chapter, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119878:24"/>though he doth not give order to the Church here to excommunicate them, which 'tis not probable he ≈øhould before <hi>reproof</hi> and <hi>admonition</hi> (e≈øpecially being newly brought over to the faith of the Go≈øpel, and ≈øo but tender) yet no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion if they had continued in this ≈øinne, as the people in the mixt Congregations do in theirs, the Church ≈øhould have had direction about it, as well as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ince≈øtuous per≈øon, and others in the fifth Chapter; for he will grant the≈øe to be ≈øcandalous ≈øins in the Church, and if per≈øi≈øted in to merit Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That the≈øe corruptions ≈øo witne≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed again≈øt by ≈øuch <hi>≈øevere reproofs</hi> and <hi>judgements</hi> from heaven ≈øhould be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as paterns of practice, is mo≈øt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurd, e≈øpecially comparing the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> &amp; our Parochial Churches, and ≈øo to draw a parallel practice, ≈øtiled <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>≈øanctified in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, the cha≈øte Spou≈øe of Chri≈øt, converted by the preaching of Paul,</hi> a Church ≈øtored with rare <hi>≈øpiritual gifts,</hi> and ours for the mo≈øt part trained up under a dead form of wor≈øhip, and a little heartle≈øs preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (for a great part, to ≈øpeak plainly again≈øt the power of godline≈øs, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119878:25"/>≈øuch as do profe≈øs it) in ignorance of the way of life and righteou≈øne≈øs by the Lord Je≈øus, living in known, gro≈øs, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ≈øins, as hath been ≈øhewed, and which cannot but be evident to the Author we deal with.</p>
            <p>To proceed, The <hi>Achillean</hi> place is the next in the ≈øame page 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. as if it were a new Di≈øcovery, when long ≈øince urged by <hi>Era≈øtus</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, the vanity of the Inference hath been over and over confuted by many godly men, which he is plea≈øed to pa≈ø≈øe by. <hi>Now</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>here is a clear Scripture for free Admi≈ø≈øion; The I≈ørael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites that pa≈ø≈øed thorow the ≈øea and wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs were baptized under the cloud, and drank of the ≈øame ≈øpiritual rock,</hi> that is, <hi>admitted freely to both Sacraments, all ≈øcandalous ones without exception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> 1. Sir, Why do you not ≈øpeak out, but here and there mince in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication? When you plead for all ≈øcandalous per≈øons to be admitted, and by con≈øequence <hi>received</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued</hi> in the Church: If the ≈øcope of all you a≈ø≈øert be in want of <hi>Di≈øcipline,</hi> why do you go about to prove it an <hi>ab≈øolute</hi> duty?</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:119878:25"/>
            <p n="2">2. Con≈øider the ≈øcope of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, which is, fir≈øt, to warn the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths</hi> of eating with Idolaters, as hath been opened, le≈øt they ≈øhould be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted back, and ≈øo fall into the ≈øame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Jews, who were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, drank of the ≈øame ≈øpiritual rock, ate manna, and yet for their ≈øins, the wrath of God came afterwards upon them: al≈øo in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ver≈øe it is ≈øaid, <hi>With many of tho≈øe God was not well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øed,</hi> which may be under≈øtood for their evil eating and drinking, as well as the re≈øt of their ≈øins, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Trap</hi> on his Notes on the place.</p>
            <p>Now if we ≈øhould allow the parallel of the≈øe types, which <hi>Beza</hi> will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to <hi>Era≈øtus,</hi> it will not in the lea≈øt mea≈øure prove his de≈øign: For fir≈øt, the manna and the water of the rock were their <hi>ordinary food,</hi> though they had al≈øo Evangelical ≈øignifications; ≈øo that if ≈øcandalous ≈øinners had been debarred of the≈øe, they had been debarred of their ordinary food, which makes a va≈øt difference between their ca≈øe in the wilderne≈ø≈øe, and ours at the Lords Table.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks of ≈øuch ≈øins as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119878:26"/>were committed <hi>after</hi> the eating of the manna, and drinking the water of the rock, for as ≈øoon as they fell to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and whoredoms the wrath of God came upon them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 26.64, 65. therefore they did not eat of the manna, and drink of the rock after the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the≈øe ≈øins: Al≈øo the≈øe ≈øcandalous ≈øinners were to be ca≈øt off by death by the Law, except ≈øuch of them as did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and ≈øo not to be admitted: Hence we have this Argument from this place again≈øt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Humfreys,</hi> as given forth by learned M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gille≈øpy in his Aarons Rod, viz.</hi> If God him≈øelf did execute ≈øuch Di≈øcipline upon tho≈øe who were tainted with Idolatry, fornication, and other gro≈øs ≈øins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to enjoy their former liberty of eating of the manna, and drinking of that rock (as typifying Chri≈øt) untill they mourned, repented, confe≈ø≈øed, and atonement was made for them; it is much le≈øs the will of God that ≈øuch ≈øcandalous ≈øinners as are impenitent, and manife≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly irreconciled to God, ≈øhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and received to the Lords Supper. But the former is true, Therefore the latter. If he urge here, They ought to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119878:26"/>be put back by Excommunication, why doth he ≈øo po≈øitively and peremptorily urge this Text to prove free Admi≈ø≈øion, when indeed the ≈øcope of the Apo≈øtle is to prove the contrary, and to warn them of it, le≈øt the ≈øame judgments come upon them al≈øo?</p>
            <p>It is ≈øad to bring that for an example of allowance (let him have what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructions he plea≈øe) which is left as an example of the fearfull judgement of God to be trembled at in all ≈øucceeding ages by all abu≈øers of Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</p>
            <p>His next Scripture is, <hi>The Parable in Marth.</hi> 22. <hi>compared with Luke</hi> 14.16, 23. <hi>that all were invited to the fea≈øt, and the ≈øervants brought in all both good and bad; whence he infers free Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. We do not finde any ≈øolid Divines under≈øtanding this fea≈øt of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor is there the lea≈øt colour ≈øo to do: But this Parable is to ≈øet forth,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The tender of the Go≈øpel to the Jews, who refu≈øing it, it is ≈øent to the Gentiles, expre≈ø≈øed by the high-wayes and hedges, the remote corners of the world; So that the calling of all in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119878:27"/>
               <hi>Luke</hi> is the call of the Go≈øpel for all to come in and accept of the terms of it; And all that come and profe≈øs ≈øubjection to it are received by the Church, and ≈øo to partake of all the Go≈øpel-Ordinances till by their conver≈øations they ≈øhall di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them≈øelves hypocrites.</p>
            <p>But ≈øaith he, <hi>In Matthew, The ≈øervants of the Ma≈øter of the fea≈øt, brought in good and bad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In an≈øwer hereunto, Fir≈øt, All both good and bad are invited freely by the Go≈øpel.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Good and bad are gathered in, but by the bad is certainly meant clo≈øe hypocrites, for when they come in, they pretend ≈øubjection to the Go≈øpel, and ≈øo are put under Go≈øpel-admini≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But Chri≈øt ≈øhews the danger of that hypocri≈øie, and that if ≈øuch as come unto the fea≈øt of the Go≈øpel in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cri≈øie not having the wedding garment, the regeneration of the Spirit upon them, ≈øhall be ca≈øt into utter darkne≈øs; That this is the plain ≈øcope of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is the a≈ø≈øent of mo≈øt godly Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters.</p>
            <p>Now that hypocrites ≈øhall be in the Church till the later day, who que≈øtions?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119878:27"/>But that when their hypocri≈øie is vi≈øible, they ≈øhall be ca≈øt out of the Church, and ≈øo not admitted to the Communion of the Church in the Supper, is clear from the Di≈øcipline Chri≈øt hath el≈øwhere in≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. and by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Humfreys</hi> own conce≈ø≈øion in allowing the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Excommunication; and though the per≈øon without the wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (repre≈øenting all the clo≈øe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites) was fir≈øt admitted by the ≈øervants, yet he was not admitted as not having a <hi>wedding garment,</hi> but ≈øuppo≈øed in a judgement of charity to have it, becau≈øe he profe≈ø≈øeth to put on Chri≈øt in ≈øubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting to him, but that he is therefore to be continued and admitted to all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances upon his ≈øcandal appearing, as we have ≈øaid, cannot in the lea≈øt mea≈øure be gathered from this Parable: But we need ≈øay no more, but that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Humfreys</hi> hath perniciou≈øly perverted the ≈øcope of the Parable, Jews and Gentiles mu≈øt be called to faith in Chri≈øt by the Mini≈øtry, Therefore ignorant and prophane mu≈øt be admitted to the Lords Supper; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not.</p>
            <p>But, ≈øaith he, <hi>This per≈øon was compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to come in</hi> (≈øtill under≈øtanding it of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119878:28"/>the Sacrament, which is we conceive confuted) <hi>which,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>was his duty, and he had no minde to come in, if he could have helpt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> If he would not have come in if he could have helpt it, &amp; ≈øo was compelled, what is this but a forcible compelling of men to the Sacrament? Sure here's liberty and free Admi≈ø≈øion de≈øtroyed again, but by a wor≈øe principle, <hi>viz.</hi> that people may be compell'd to the Sacrament, though they have no minde to come; for what el≈øe can be gather'd from that expre≈ø≈øion? If he then do ≈øo under≈øtand it of a forcible compelling to the Sacrament again≈øt mens wils, we referre him for an an≈øwer to all ≈øolid Prote≈øtant Divines again≈øt the Papi≈øts, urging this Scripture for forcible compelling to ≈øubject to the Church, and ≈øo to make Churches by the ≈øword; And likewi≈øe to what hath been an≈øwer'd to the practice of the Prelates in puni≈øhing per≈øons if they came not once a year to the Sacrament, which is now hi≈øt at by all the godly in the Nation, as a practice mo≈øt abominable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>to come was not his ≈øinne</hi> (≈øtill unduly meaning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119878:28"/>
               <hi>but without his wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath been an≈øwered, that to come is not his duty unle≈øs he hath his wedding garment; 'tis his greater ≈øinne to come ≈øo, then to refrain, becau≈øe 'tis an abominable mocking of the Lord, who hath laid upon men no ab≈øolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to come, but a conditional, therefore not to come according to the conditional command is the ≈øin.</p>
            <p>By this compelling therefore is meant the <hi>free invitations</hi> and <hi>compellations</hi> of the Go≈øpel (<hi>Evangelii inculcatione &amp; hortationum in≈øtanti√¢,</hi> as <hi>Bucer</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.) upon which the Gentiles ≈øhall come into it, and not of compelling men again≈øt their wils to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a practice the ≈øoul of the Lord abhors.</p>
            <p>His fourth Ob≈øervation, <hi>Pag.</hi> 10. <hi>That our Saviour explains his own Parable, Many are called, few are cho≈øen; That is, ≈øaith he, the work of the Ministry, we are freely to offer Christ in his Ordinances; but few are cho≈øen, that is the work of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Very true, many are outwardly called by the Go≈øpel, but few cho≈øen,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119878:29"/>'tis only known to the Lord who are his cho≈øen ones, and therefore the Church looks to <hi>outward profe≈ø≈øion</hi> and <hi>calling,</hi> but if any deny their <hi>call,</hi> by <hi>contrary walking</hi> to it, nothing is here gathered to the contrary, but the Church mu≈øt ca≈øt them out; Secret election belongs to God, but the electing of ≈øitly qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed per≈øons to the Lords Supper, belongs to the Church; It is the work of the Mini≈øters to <hi>offer Christ freely in the Ordinances,</hi> but in <hi>Chri≈øts own way</hi> and <hi>method,</hi> to offer him <hi>fir≈øt</hi> in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance, and if any ≈øoul <hi>profe≈øs</hi> to embrace him before the Lord and the Church, then to have the ≈øeal of his love in the Supper, which things indeed he doth <hi>confound</hi> and <hi>mix</hi> all the way, and which being di≈øcovered the ≈ønare is broken.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That few are cho≈øen, that is the work of God, yea that the ≈øervant brought in the man, it was the Lord only took upon him to judge and ca≈øt him out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Who doubts this, but it is the Lords work to choo≈øe? The Church meddles not with mens <hi>election,</hi> but their <hi>calling</hi> and <hi>profe≈ø≈øion;</hi> it is <hi>his</hi> work to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119878:29"/>ca≈øt out, his <hi>work alone</hi> to di≈øcover clo≈øe hypocrites at the la≈øt day; But, <hi>Sir,</hi> we be≈øeech you, Is this <hi>exclu≈øive</hi> of all other <hi>ca≈øting out</hi> by the Church, why then do you ≈øpeak of Excommunication? Your indeed continued contradiction: Is not the Church to ca≈øt out open ≈øcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous per≈øons, or to withdraw from ≈øuch as ≈øcorn at Di≈øcipline, or have been unduly admitted as compleat members into the Church, being gro≈øly ignorant? ≈øurely you will grant both.</p>
            <p>He concludes this Argument as with a victory from <hi>Luke</hi> 12.42. <hi>Who is that faithfull ≈øteward that gives the hou≈øhold their portion in due ≈øea≈øon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> We an≈øwer (and may we do it with grief of heart) not ≈øuch as give their Ma≈øters bread to dogs, his enemies in their wicked lives; or ≈øuch as refu≈øe to <hi>profe≈øs ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion</hi> and <hi>≈øubjection</hi> to him, being called thereunto; He is a <hi>faithfull ≈øteward</hi> who <hi>ca≈øts</hi> out his ma≈øters traiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enemies, who di≈øhonour his <hi>family,</hi> and gives his <hi>bread,</hi> the <hi>≈øeal</hi> of his love, to his <hi>hou≈øhold</hi> onely; A ≈øtronger Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument needed not be brought again≈øt him.</p>
            <p>The Lord forbid the godly Mini≈øters
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119878:30"/>of this Nation ≈øhould now, after all their crying for Reformation be found ≈øuch Stewards as <hi>free Admi≈ø≈øion</hi> would have them.</p>
            <p>What he urgeth from <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. is as impertinent, where <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth the Elders of the Church of <hi>Ephe≈øus, to take heed, and to feed the Church of God,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Ephe≈ø. 2.22. &amp; 4.16.</note> That Church which is de≈øcribed to be <hi>built up as an habitation of God thorow the Spirit,</hi> fitly framed and compacted together, as brought into the order of the Go≈øpel, by the holy and powerfull preaching of it by the Apo≈øtles.</p>
            <p>Now, 1. What's this to ignorant, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, carnal, formal, profane, ≈øuper≈øtitious and malicious Congregations, that they mu≈øt ≈øtill be fed with this Ordinance, to the flattering of them in a mi≈øerable ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ≈øtate, and ≈øend them with a cruel pity to hell with them?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such are not fit to be <hi>fed</hi> with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which have not <hi>feeding</hi> ≈øouls for it.</p>

               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> 1. It is que≈øtioned by many learned men, Whether the≈øe Phari≈øees were baptized by <hi>John;</hi> but if we grant they were, we an≈øwer,</p>

            <p>His next Scripture is <hi>Acts</hi> 10.28. which he cals a peculiar place; <hi>Peter,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>Was very ≈øcrupulous of admitting Chri≈øtian Communion With any but the Jews, it being held pollution under the Law to partieipate in any thing with the Gentiles, but after the vi≈øion God in≈øtructed him to call no man unclean.</hi> Reader, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve this,</p>
            <p>Becau≈øe <hi>Peter</hi> had a vi≈øion that the Go≈øpel was to come to the Gentiles, and therefore he might have conver≈øt with them, therefore every Gentile, every leud, ignorant, profane per≈øon, is to be accounted ≈øo elean, as to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Lords Supper: For this is the whole force of the Argument: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man knows that by that vi≈øion no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing el≈øe is meant but the preaching of the Go≈øpel to the Gentiles; ≈øure con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate unprejudiced per≈øons will not be

            <p>To the≈øe he adds the texts which ≈øet forth free grace, and ≈øo pleads; <hi>When the Go≈øpel freely offers Chri≈øt, when Chri≈øt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers him≈øelf and grace, which are the things ≈øignified, How can any have the con≈øcience to turn them away from the ≈øigns?</hi>

               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> If there be the ≈øame latitude of admini≈øtring the Go≈øpel and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, then to whom≈øoever the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel is preacht, the Sacraments are al≈øo to be admini≈øtred. The Go≈øpel is preacht to all the world, therefore all the world to take the Sacrament. Sir, you know well enough that the Apo≈øtles preacht the Go≈øpel to whole Cities, yea Nations, but admini≈øtred the Sacraments only to ≈øuch as came and profe≈ø≈øed repentance and ≈øubjection to the Lord Je≈øus. Upon this ≈øcore, as many as hear the Go≈øpel preached, profe≈ø≈øing to be converted or not converted, may come and eat bread and wine with the Church at plea≈øure. A mon≈øtrous profanene≈øs.</p>
            <p>But his rea≈øon is, <hi>Becau≈øe this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ≈øhews forth the death of Chri≈øt, and this is,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>Pauls judgment of Chri≈øts In≈øtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Sir, To whom did it ≈øhew forth
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119878:33"/>the Lords death, and who were to u≈øe it for that end? Were they not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øing Saints of <hi>Corinth,</hi> ≈øuch that had <hi>given up them≈øelves to the Lord by the will of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Briefly, let it be ≈øhewed, that Je≈øus Chri≈øt did in≈øtitute Sacraments for any other then profe≈ø≈øing beleevers, or make any promi≈øe to them for conver≈øion, or whether they were ever admini≈øtred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any but ≈øuch as owned and ≈øubmitted to the Church: But he will not ≈øure ≈øay, the Go≈øpel is to be preacht to no other, therefore there is not the ≈øame latitude in the admini≈øtration of both.</p>
            <p>But he further urgeth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. for this, <hi>O ye Galathians, before whom Chri≈øt hath been ≈øet out, as crucified among you. This expre≈ø≈øion,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>may well be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Sacraments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True, it may be, but it is clear it was not the Apo≈øtles meaning there, but the doctrine of Chri≈øt crucified, from the power of which they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting.</p>
            <p>But grant it were, What doth he gain by it? It only will prove, that the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> (as a Church) received the Lords Supper, and that Chri≈øt was ≈øet out to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119878:34"/>the eye of a beleever; What's this to prove the ≈øame latitude of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Go≈øpel and admini≈øtring Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
            <p>He is willing to prove it further by a Metaphor; <hi>A man covenants with a Landlord about a purcha≈øe, the price being paid, the bargain e≈øtabli≈øht, he comes and requires his Seal for confirmation; So Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt makes a purcha≈øe for us, gives us the writing and ≈øeal in the Go≈øpel and Sacrament.</hi> This is the ≈øub≈øtance.</p>
            <p>Very true, but mu≈øt not the <hi>party</hi> for whom this purcha≈øe is made come fir≈øt and accept of the bargain upon its own terms, and ≈øo have it ≈øealed to his u≈øe? ≈øo mu≈øt not every ≈øoul fir≈øt profe≈øs to accept Je≈øus Chri≈øt on his own terms, and ≈øo the Church in the name of Chri≈øt to give him the ≈øeal, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>a Prince proclaims a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don upon condition of laying down their arms, and ≈øo gives forth a pardon and ≈øeal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>We ≈øhall not adde any thing to the other part of this con≈øideration, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>But he goeth on, <hi>Now unle≈øs men will be ≈øo bold, as to dive≈øt our mixt Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of the name of the vi≈øible Church, they cannot take away one e≈ø≈øential note, in the free u≈øe of this Ordinance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> But, Sir, there is much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the reforming of a Church, that there may be a due and ju≈øtifiable u≈øe of this Ordinance, and a taking of it away, which we know none but fanatick per≈øons who deny the u≈øe of this Ordinance to do.</p>
            <p>But he will prove, <hi>That our mixt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations ought to have the u≈øe of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, both from Chri≈øts doctrine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</hi>

            <p>His Doctrine, <hi>In the Parables of the little and great fi≈øhes in one net, good and bad called to one feast, the chaff and wheat in one barn, tares and wheat in one field,</hi> Mat. 13. <hi>which mu≈øt grow together till the day of Judgement, and ≈øo no ≈øeparation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Briefly, Tho≈øe tares we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand, with mo≈øt reformed Expo≈øitours, to be clo≈øe hypocrites, and nor of open profane per≈øons and revilers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel-Mini≈øtry, and of the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs, el≈øe to what purpo≈øe doth he el≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ≈øpeak of Excommunication, which is to ca≈øt ≈øuch as pretend to be Chri≈øts friends, but walk as his enemies, out of the Church? And if under pretence of this, all ungodly bla≈øphemous wretches, gro≈øs ignorants, mu≈øt be admitted: What difference between the Church and the Kingdom of the devil?</p>
            <p>We allow there is no ≈øeparation from clo≈øe hypocrites, <hi>De occultis non judicat Eccle≈øia.</hi> But as to open, di≈øcovered, ≈øcandalous per≈øons, the Church is to ca≈øt them out; or if they are the greater part, to withdraw from them, as hath been ≈øhewed.</p>
            <p>If it be reply'd, That the ≈øervants knew them to be tares, therefore not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119878:39"/>clo≈øe hypocrites: We an≈øwer, That godly Mini≈øters may di≈øcern hypocrites with a knowledge of probability, and ≈øo the≈øe ≈øervants might di≈øcover the tares; ≈øpecially if by <hi>Zizania</hi> the≈øe tares are meant burnt ears of corn, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Leigh,</hi> M, <hi>Trap</hi> and <hi>Weems,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is al≈øo ≈øaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.25. <hi>While men ≈ølept the enemy ≈øowed tares;</hi> Where Chri≈øt imputes it to the remi≈øne≈øs and ≈øleepine≈øs of the ≈øervants, the Mini≈øters, that tares came into and were ≈øuffered in the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By tho≈øe tares, Chri≈øt doth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand, ≈øuch who are not openly and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou≈øly ≈øcandalous, but ≈øuch tares who are much like the wheat (as <hi>Hierom</hi> ≈øaith tho≈øe kinde of tares were) el≈øe he would contradict him≈øelf, in commanding ≈øcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous per≈øons to be ca≈øt out of the Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. and yet here to command them to let them alone.</p>
            <p>To conclude his Argument he breaks out in Rhetorick, <hi>Who Lord dare antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate thy throne to ≈øeparate?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>None, we hope, <hi>viz.</hi> to undertake to ≈øeparate all clo≈øe hypocrites out of the Church, as hath been ≈øaid; but there are ≈øome who may and ought to be ≈øo
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119878:39"/>bold (whereof we believe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Humfreys,</hi> and his Church to be a part) to exerci≈øe that power Chri≈øt hath left them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve their Churches from <hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;</hi> el≈øe all Chri≈øts threatnings to the Churches of <hi>A≈øia</hi> for continuing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanene≈øs, bla≈øphemy, lukewarmne≈øs among them, commending them that could not bear the evil had been vain; What el≈øe indeed is the Church of Chri≈øt, but ≈øuch a ≈øeparation of believers from the pollution and wickedne≈øs of the world?</p>
            <p>Next he would prove it from Chri≈øts example, <hi>Who conver≈øed with Publicans and ≈øinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> This will ≈øerve, as it hath ever done, the turns of the profane people to urge again≈øt the ≈øtrict and re≈øerved carriage of the godly, in not frequently mixing in their companies, as they abu≈øe this Scripture; but it is ≈øad to have it ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by a Mini≈øter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becau≈øe Chri≈øt conver≈øed with Publicans and ≈øinners to convert them, therefore did he admit them, <hi>as ≈øuch,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Family, and give them the ≈øeals of his love, which mu≈øt be the import of the Argument, if it pretend to prove
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119878:40"/>any thing; If you had Infidels dwelling near you, becau≈øe you did ≈øometime conver≈øe with them, Would it be a good Argument for any to urge again≈øt you, that you therefore gave them the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Were Publicans and ≈øinners ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for his Di≈øciples, or to his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, till called and became followers of Chri≈øt?</p>
            <p>But now comes in the invincible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>viz. That Chri≈øt ate the Pa≈ø≈øeover and his own Supper With Judas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> We ≈øhall for brevities ≈øake avoid this conte≈øt, Whether Chri≈øt did give the Supper to <hi>Judas.</hi> The Author pa≈ø≈øeth by the many pre≈ø≈øing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are given to the contrary by many learned men, ≈øpecially M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Only this, It is not likely that the Lord Je≈øus ≈øhould ≈øay to one who was about to betray him, <hi>Take, eat my body, which was given for thee?</hi> for if <hi>Judas</hi> received it, Chri≈øt ≈øpake to him with the re≈øt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it be replyed, That Chri≈øt dealt as an ordinary Mini≈øter in this admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtration, then it will help to fortifie the an≈øwer we chiefly ≈øtick to (≈øuppo≈øing we
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119878:40"/>grant him that <hi>Judas</hi> did receive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which is, That Chri≈øt dealt as an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Mini≈øter, and ≈øo <hi>Judas</hi> was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a clo≈øe hypocrite. Be≈øides, <hi>Judas</hi> had not committed the finne, as yet, and ordinary Mini≈øters do not u≈øe to keep any from the Sacrament for ≈øins they fear they may hereafter commit, but have not yet committed them.</p>
            <p>Now all that will not admit of his a√´ry free Admi≈ø≈øion, are wilfully blinde, as he concludes, cen≈øoriou≈øly enough, again≈øt the judgement of mo≈øt famous holy Divines, both ancient, reformed and modern, as ever the world was ble≈øt with ≈øince the Apo≈øtles times. This may gain opinion with his Pari≈øhioners, but not with the godly wi≈øe.</p>
            <p>His third rea≈øon is, <hi>From the nature of Christian Communion and Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low≈øhip, which ought,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>to be in charity and humility, without judging,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to judge others better then them≈øelves, ≈øpecially in the Mini≈øter, from</hi> 2 Tim. 2.24, 25.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> 1. As to Church-fellow≈øhip, <hi>The fellow≈øhip of Saints with the Father, and with Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> by mutual union and free agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119878:41"/>in the Lord. There's ≈øure but little foot≈øteps of it in the mo≈øt parochial frames.</p>
            <p>How were they united into ≈øuch a holy fellow≈øhip? Is a coming together of gro≈øly ignorant, ≈øwearers, profaners of the Sabbath, abetting and pleading for all ungodline≈øs, haters of ≈øuch as are godly, like a fellow≈øhip of Saints, as the Primitive Churches were? We may boldly return this Argument upon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Humfreys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Church-fellow≈øhip, is a holy fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip of Saints walking in the light, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3, 7. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.6. <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 5.8, 9, 10, 11. 'Tis not a fellow≈øhip of Saints and devils (appearing even to be ≈øo) of light and darkne≈øs; therefore all manner of wretched per≈øons, wallowing in all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thine≈øs and profanene≈øs; ought not to be received into it.</p>
            <p>But ≈øaith he, <hi>It ought to be in humility and charity,</hi> yea men profe≈ø≈øing Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip ought ≈øo to walk together, and all for bearance as to one anothers infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be u≈øed. But what kinde of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is this to admit ungodly per≈øons, as the members of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, walking indeed as the members of Satan: So the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119878:41"/>truth is, profane people cry out, Oh you-mu≈øt have charity! The reforming Mini≈øters have no charity, and the like; when too many have equivalently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced every part and article of their Covenant made to God in bapti≈øm, not minding to renew it; yet they blame us as uncharitable, becau≈øe we will not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them in their abominations with the precious ≈øeal of Chri≈øts love, when they walk as his enemies, and have their mouths open again≈øt all goodne≈øs; That this is the temper of mo≈øt, witne≈øs the preaching of all godly Mini≈øters.</p>
            <p>Now what a kinde of charity were this? Oh, mercile≈øs flattering pity!</p>
            <p>Again, we be≈øeech you to remember, that Church-fellow≈øhip mu≈øt be as well in holine≈øs as in charity, here is no pleading for purity, but all for peace and charity.</p>
            <p>But ≈øaith he, <hi>We ought to judge others better then our ≈øelves;</hi> but Sir, this ≈øure was ever pre≈øt upon ≈øuch as profe≈ø≈øed Saint≈øhip in the Churches of Chri≈øt, not of ≈øuch, who though they will be good Chri≈øtians in their own and others e≈øteem, do yet hate the name of Saint, and revile it; ≈øuch an humble Chri≈øtian
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119878:42"/>is not in the greate≈øt humility, to e≈øteem better then him≈øelf, as the grace of Chri≈øt hath di≈øtingui≈øhed him.</p>
            <p>But he puts an <hi>e≈øpecially</hi> to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter for this excellent humility and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he is to be patient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Did ever any man under≈øtand that Scripture of admini≈øtring Sacraments, but him≈øelf?</p>
            <p>Be≈øides, though this is to be a Mini≈øters carriage, yet one duty doth not cla≈øh with another, he ought to do his duty al≈øo, to keep Chri≈øts Ordinances pure, and to try the people he is ≈øent to,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh,</hi> but ≈øaith he, <hi>If we mu≈øt go cen≈øuring one anothers worthine≈øs, 'tis the ready way to heart-burnings,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We have before an≈øwered, that we take leave to call this but a very carnal Argument, Chri≈øt came not to give ≈øuch a kinde of peace between Saints and the wicked.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides, this ≈øtrikes at all Di≈øcipline, which mu≈øt not hence be exerci≈øed for fear of heart-burnings. It may indeed make the Mini≈øters many enemies; The Lord grant this be not too great a ≈ønare upon many; free Admi≈ø≈øion makes
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119878:42"/>much for the <hi>ea≈øe, peace</hi> and <hi>intere≈øt</hi> of a Mini≈øter in the world: but it maketh him an unfaithfull ≈øteward of the my≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God.</p>
            <p>Now, to crown all, he is plea≈øed to adde, <hi>That it is but a rigid Phari≈øai≈øm to deny free Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, You have abundantly gratified prophane people (into who≈øe hand your Book comes) and helps on the old accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øation of godly Mini≈øters and people, <hi>viz.</hi> That all this ≈øtrictne≈øs they pretend to, is but Phari≈øai≈øm and hypocri≈øie; your ≈øinne and doom is 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.2.</p>
            <p>We do not plead for <hi>rigidne≈øs</hi> truly ≈øo called; Godly Mini≈øters invite the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt to profe≈øs repentance, and faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ≈øo to be received into Communion: but for the withholding of the holy things of Chri≈øt from ≈øtubborn per≈øons who <hi>≈øcorn</hi> ≈øuch profe≈ø≈øion, is no more then Chri≈øt commanded M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Humfreys</hi> and us to practi≈øe.</p>
            <p>The compari≈øon of the <hi>Phari≈øee</hi> and <hi>Publican</hi> is the old charge of the luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm carnal party again≈øt <hi>Profe≈ø≈øors</hi> of godline≈øs: Oh, ≈øay they, the≈øe will be holy, they are ≈øo ≈øtrict, ju≈øt like the Phari≈øees; Why? becau≈øe they will not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119878:43"/>partake with them in the unfruitfull works of darkne≈øs, and now would not be guilty of their Sacrament-≈øins, which they are, if they do not their duty to keep them off.</p>
            <p>Next, he breaks out with a pathetical expo≈øtulation and prayer, <hi>Rebuke the humour of the≈øe times, Oh my Saviour!</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Reformation is but a humour, and ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øtition with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Humfreys;</hi> Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus rebuke the profanene≈øs of the≈øe times, and let not thy holy things be thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtituted! Rebuke them that call evil good, and good evil.</p>
            <p>Another he follows with, <hi>That ≈øince Chri≈øt offered him≈øelf to ≈øinners, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ca≈øt out any that came, Shall any take ≈øtomack he is offered in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> This is the former confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things that ought to be di≈øtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed; If a ≈øoul profe≈øs to <hi>come</hi> to Chri≈øt, that is, to ≈øubject to him, and walk with his people, who will deny him the Seal? Doth it therefore follow that the Lords Supper is to be given to tho≈øe who do not <hi>come</hi> to him, and being call'd upon <hi>will not</hi> profe≈øs to do ≈øo?</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:119878:43"/>
            <p>But let us enquire, Doth the Author of <hi>free Admi≈ø≈øion</hi> conceive, that Je≈øus Chri≈øt would have admitted Publicans and ≈øinners to his Supper without any more ado? Were they not fir≈øt to be received as Di≈øciples? Here's his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Chri≈øt ≈øometimes conver≈øt with Publicans and ≈øinners, therefore all may come to the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>His next Scripture is <hi>John</hi> 8. about the adultre≈ø≈øe woman, ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>He that is without ≈øinne, ca≈øt a ≈øtone at her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was to check the proud Phari≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øm of others, who ≈øcorn'd her out of vain-glory, when they them≈øelves were guilty of as great ≈øins; Mu≈øt therefore adultere≈ø≈øes without profe≈ø≈øed humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Church be received to the Lords Supper? Though a beleever finds the ≈øame corruption in him≈øelf, and is aba≈øed in it, yet he ≈øees him≈øelf di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øht through grace from an unhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled adultre≈ø≈øe, from ≈øuch that live in open ≈øcandalous ≈øins, which he pleads for to come to this holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>His fourth rea≈øon ≈øpeaks high words, <hi>Which doth ari≈øe from the vanity, formality,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119878:44"/>impo≈ø≈øibility of ≈øelecting people to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prove either of the≈øe di≈øtinctly, nothing is offered, onely ≈øomething in the general; 1. <hi>Look but to the heart of the≈øe ≈øeparations, and they come to nothing.</hi> This is as ≈ølightly as uncharitably ≈øpoken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> If he means by ≈øeparations, the uniting of ≈øuch as profe≈øs repentance and faith before the Lord and his people into a clo≈øer fellow≈øhip, that all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances may be rightly admini≈øtred: We an≈øwer, The≈øe ≈øeparations, ble≈ø≈øed be the name of the Lord, came to ≈øomething, and the good hand of the Lord is with them, and hath gloriou≈øly appeared for them. But to ≈øpeak plainly, we wonder what the mixt Parochial Congregations for the mo≈øt part came to, if we look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lea≈øt of them, where no Church-Reformation is practi≈øed, even the very lea≈øt of them is carnal, formal, dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted wor≈øhip, no fellow≈øhip toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor mutual edification, but ≈øetled upon the dead lees of formality, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to their own de≈øtruction in ≈øuch a condition by a continued enjoyment of all Ordinances, without any di≈øcovery
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119878:44"/>(but by meer coming to the Ordinances) that they ≈øo much as pretend to Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be≈øides, godly men doe not ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, but invite all upon profe≈ø≈øion of owning the Lords Covenant, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Now if he means by ≈øuch a bare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal profe≈ø≈øion, without any regard to knowledge or conver≈øation, we deny it to be enough, if this be all they mixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> 1. The Scripture ≈øaith, that Circumci≈øion to <hi>Abraham</hi> was the <hi>Seal of the righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe of faith,</hi> Rom. 4.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be the Seal of the Covenant on Gods part, as of one party being agreed, yet if a ≈øoul do not <hi>accept</hi> of, and <hi>agree to the terms</hi> of it, it is but as a <hi>blank</hi> to him, there being not a <hi>mutual a≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation</hi> and <hi>agreement</hi> on both parts, and ≈øo ≈øuch a ≈øoul hath no good by it: If by this he would encourage a poor trembling ≈øoul, who doubts of his faith, he may make u≈øe of it, 'tis not of ≈øuch we here di≈øpute of.</p>
               <p>But he puts the Objection forward,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119878:59"/>viz. <hi>Were it not ab≈øurd for a man to ≈øet his Seal, where there hath been no agreement and tran≈øactions before? ≈øo do unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men, who come to the Sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that ≈øolemn giving up the ≈øoul to God, as he ought who enters into Covenant with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this he An≈øwers, <hi>That there are too many come ab≈øurdly and wickedly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>Though the receiver fail on his part in his ≈øolemn mutual engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (whereof he is to repent) yet as for the Mini≈øter and Church there is a true ≈øeal to a true Copy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Now we reply to him, There is a true Seal to a true Copy, but not to be delivered to <hi>rebels,</hi> unle≈ø≈øe they come <hi>profe≈ø≈øing</hi> humbly to <hi>accept</hi> the terms of it: Here is the thing we ≈øtick at, we require, and ≈øo we verily beleeve doth the Lord, that the Receiver ought ≈øolemnly to profe≈ø≈øe and give up him≈øelf to God, and enter into Covenant with him before he be admitted by them to the <hi>Seal</hi> of it, if the per≈øon do not this in ≈øincerity, let him look to that; but that he do it is the <hi>Churches</hi> part to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him, without which we beleeve he cannot fully acquit the Church as he
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119878:60"/>undertake to do, <hi>p.</hi> 47. And without this, in≈øtead of (nothing) being <hi>out</hi> of order (as he ≈øpeaks) there is hardly any thing <hi>in</hi> order: Now if the receiver do this, the Mini≈øter and Church receive him in the judgement of Love, as a regenerate per≈øon; and ≈øo they do not ≈øin in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the Sacrament as a Seal on Gods part.</p>
               <p>But, ≈øaith he, <hi>The Sacrament ≈øeals ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the truth of the Covenant freely to all, engaging them unto it, and the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt and benefits of it to every ≈øingle per≈øon upon the terms, conditions, tenour of the Go≈øpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> With this notion, which he ≈øaith hath layn as an Embryon a long time, he profe≈ø≈øeth him≈øelf and another piercing Godly man to be converted with it: We ≈øhall not judge them in this their conver≈øion, but take boldne≈øs from the deceit we have learned in our own hearts, That 'tis no hard matter to get di≈øtinctions to pacifie the con≈øcience in a trouble≈øom work, as the practi≈øe of Reformation is: We an≈øwer, the blood of Chri≈øt ≈øeals the Covenant of God, but when tis offered in the ≈øign of it, the Sacrament, it is to ≈øuch per≈øons, who
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119878:60"/>accept of the Covenant upon the terms and conditions of it (as him≈øelf ≈øpeaks) and of the blood of Chri≈øt thereby ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, and it ≈øeals to none but to them who have communion with the blood of Chri≈øt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. therefore it doth not generally ≈øeal to all. The Sacrament is not ≈øaid to ≈øeal the Covenant to all; tis the Seal of the Covenant, but it ≈øeals it <hi>to</hi> none but to the Believer, who is to engage unto it, fir≈øt, <hi>Sincerely,</hi> as to his own intere≈øt in it. Secondly, <hi>Profe≈ø≈øedly</hi> and <hi>explicitly,</hi> as to the Churches ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: To ≈øeal any thing to a per≈øon, implies a reciprocall agreement. We humbly take leave to ≈øay, that as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øeth his greate≈øt ≈øatisfaction in this argument, his greate≈øt mi≈øtake lies in it, in confounding of things that ought to be di≈øtingui≈øhed.</p>
               <p>We ≈øay, the tender of the Covenant is fir≈øt in the preaching of the Go≈øpel, upon which beleevers profe≈ø≈øe to own and accept of, and enter into it, (not by a meer tacit coming) which having done before the Lord and the Church, then, as the Sacrament ≈øhall be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtred, the Seal is annexed to it, and a beleever receives the blood of Chri≈øt
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119878:61"/>Je≈øus as a Seal of Gods promi≈øes <hi>in the remi≈ø≈øion of his ≈øins,</hi> and ≈øo to every cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting per≈øon (profe≈ø≈øing to do ≈øo) the Covenant is offered and ≈øealed to him, and to none other.</p>
               <p>Now in ≈øtead of this, we conceive through the whole Treati≈øe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>H.</hi> would have a Sacrament, which (being the Seal of the Covenant) is to be tendered to all, be they what they will, without any <hi>previous act</hi> of the Receivers, either <hi>confe≈ø≈øion, profe≈ø≈øion</hi> or <hi>covenanting</hi> with or before the Church, which was never the way of the Go≈øpel in admi≈ø≈øion of Church-members, and ≈øo it holds the ≈øame in the u≈øe of the Supper, when though baptized they have never given any account of them≈øelves, or are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane in their lives.</p>
               <p>Further, he urgeth his ≈øubtile Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øm to analy≈øe the whole argument,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Covenant,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>means thus, He that beleeveth ≈øhall be ≈øaved: adde, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,</hi> ergo <hi>I ≈øhall be ≈øaved. Now,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>the Sacrament ≈øeals to the</hi> major, <hi>not to the</hi> minor, <hi>to Gods own Word, not to ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Fir≈øt, The <hi>major</hi> or fir≈øt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition is rather a conditionall promi≈øe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119878:61"/>of the Covenant, then the Covenant it ≈øelf; and ≈øo the Sacrament ≈øeals condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally. But without the≈øe quirks, If the Sacrament ≈øeal to every Beleever, then if I adde, But I am a Beleever, then it ≈øeals to me: and though the Scripture do not ≈øpeak of any particular man, who is a Beleever, yet in ≈øuch a Syllogi≈øm it it ≈øpeaks as fully, and even as ≈øatisfying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a poor ≈øoul as if it did: Sir, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ≈øeals the truth of mercy and grace and life to poor ≈øouls that come rightly to it, and not to ab≈øtracted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions and notions, with which you puzzle weak people.</p>
               <p>Again, ≈øtick to the propo≈øition as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally applyed, the Sacrament ≈øeals to this, <hi>He that beleeveth ≈øhall be ≈øaved,</hi> and the Sacrament confirms it to him, then let none but ≈øuch as ≈øhall be charitably judged <hi>Beleevers</hi> profe≈ø≈øing faith and obedience be admitted to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 5. The fifth Objection he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to An≈øwer,<note place="margin">Pag. 49.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. The Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to all, therefore the ≈øeals nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this he An≈øwers, by di≈øtingui≈øhing of the Covenant, <hi>≈øometimes taken for the ab≈øolute promi≈øes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>≈øometimes for the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119878:62"/>tenour of the Go≈øpel in Gods revealed will, and ≈øo it runs on the≈øe terms, Who≈øoever beleeves ≈øhall be ≈øaved, and whether this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to all, tis no que≈øtion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Tis true, ≈øalvation belongs to all in the tender of it, as him≈øelf ≈øaith in the next page; The conditional Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is tendred in the word, and ≈øealed to in the Sacrament: Now as the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is tendred in the Word, if ≈øouls profe≈ø≈øe to accept of the tender of it, and to Covenant with him, then 'tis ≈øeald in the Sacrament. The Sacrament is a Seal between God and the Beleever, and ≈øuppo≈øeth beleeving, intended to Seal mercy to profe≈ø≈øing covenanting Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and upon that ≈øcore the Church doth admini≈øter it, receiving them as ≈øuch.</p>
               <p>Next, he declareth his own practi≈øe, That he ≈øhews his hearers the conditions of the Covenant, ≈øuch that accept of them, there the Seal of God is ready, let them put to their hands and ≈øeals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This the import.</p>
               <p>But Sir, Is it not more proper, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ≈øatisfying, that ≈øuch per≈øons upon the tender of the Covenant, ≈øhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and profe≈ø≈øe to own and enter into
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119878:62"/>the Covenant of God? Mu≈øt all be done in a huddle the ≈øame hour, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be as mutes in this great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Would it not be for the honour of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, that people with their own mouths confe≈ø≈øe him, according to the mea≈øure God hath given them, more for the ≈øatisfaction of the Mini≈øter and Church, yea, and for the comfort of the Profe≈ø≈øour, then thus hand over head to deal in this weighty matter? Special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øince this was never had from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England,</hi> as we have before open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who are ≈øo ≈øetled in a corrupt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, cu≈øtomary way in the u≈øe of this Ordinance, for the mo≈øt part, That talk you of Covenant and Seal, and what you will, They mu≈øt have the Communion, though to the great prejudice of their ≈øouls; And 'tis from the≈øe ≈øad corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by the iniquity of former and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent times; As the <hi>London</hi> Mini≈øters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in their <hi>Plea for Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> That ≈øuch a Profe≈ø≈øion and triall is fir≈øt to be had of every per≈øon; ≈øeeing the abu≈øe of this Ordinance was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and horribly prophane.</p>
               <p>In the clo≈øe (≈øaith he) <hi>This Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth more properly belong to him
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119878:63"/>who is not yet in Covenant with God, ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing now he re≈øolves to enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a ≈øtrange doctrine, and we verily beleeve never ≈øtarted before, Here is ≈øtill the ≈øame confu≈øion; But Sir, In this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance doth not the Church (for here we deal with it upon this account, which is the Churches and Mini≈øters duty in this Ordinance) ≈øuppo≈øe every receiver in Covenant before, fir≈øt as tendred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it in Bapti≈øm, and ≈øecondly, as requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a per≈øonall owning and profe≈ø≈øing of the Covenant and the conditions of it (which was ever the practice of the Primitive Churches, as hath been urged) and ≈øo admini≈øter the Lords Supper to them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. How doth he here confound the <hi>order</hi> and even make void the <hi>care</hi> of the Church in this matter.</p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>tender</hi> and <hi>offer</hi> of it, we have already ≈øpoken; We a≈ø≈øert there ought to be a <hi>previous profe≈ø≈øion</hi> of acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation of the tender and offer by every ≈øoul, before the ≈øeal is admini≈øtred to him, or el≈øe all <hi>order</hi> and <hi>purity</hi> will be de≈øtroyed.</p>
               <p>And therefore we conclude this, that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119878:63"/>the Covenant belongs not to all, ≈øo as to have it ≈øealed unto them, unle≈ø≈øe they fir≈øt vi≈øibly profe≈ø≈øe to own it and accept of it before the Church; The former neglect of which cau≈øeth now a requiring of it of every per≈øon, or el≈øe godly men ≈øee not how Reformation will be attained to.</p>
               <p>But he produceth a Reply to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer an≈øwer; <hi>viz. What right doth this give him to the Covenant?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He an≈øwers with the main ≈øcope of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Argument he produceth; As the <hi>Sacrament is a ≈øhewing forth of Chri≈øt with a tender of the Covenant in his bloud, there is an open, free, generall right to it for all that will come into Chri≈øt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We an≈øwer, The Sacrament is a ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of Chri≈øt with a tender, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to whom? To profe≈ø≈øing beleevers that have been orderly received into the Church upon the Go≈øpel preached to them? And for ≈øuch as profe≈ø≈øe before to <hi>come into Chri≈øt</hi> and ≈øubject to di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and who≈øe conver≈øations do not deny it, at lea≈øt profe≈ø≈øing ≈øerious repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the ≈øins they have lived in; which he grants to be the duty of every receiver, as to his own con≈øcience, in his
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119878:64"/>former an≈øwer, <hi>p.</hi> 50. But this we a≈ø≈øert to be needfull to be profe≈ø≈øed as to the ≈øatisfaction of the Church; Due re≈øpect and tenderne≈ø≈øe being had to the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty of any and to particulars.</p>
               <p>But he further di≈øtingui≈øheth of a right of coming, <hi>There's a right of obligation and a right of priviledge; for the right of obligation in the Mini≈øters offer of Chri≈øt freely, and the Peoples receiving him on his own terms, I do avouch an univer≈øall right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø,</hi> This is true in a ≈øen≈øe, ≈øo order be ob≈øerved; If indeed a people <hi>receive Chri≈øt on his own terms</hi> (as he ≈øpeaks) and <hi>profe≈ø≈øe</hi> to do ≈øo, then an obligation in the Mini≈øter to give the Sacrament; And the people being in their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences, in ≈øome good mea≈øure ≈øatisfied, they came ≈øincerely before the Lord, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving examined their own hearts, there's a right of obligation upon them al≈øo to come.</p>
               <p>But if he mean an <hi>ab≈øolute</hi> obligation of all to come, we deny it, unle≈ø≈øe he is ahle to examine himielf, and doth ≈øo; and profe≈ø≈øeth to the Church to take Chri≈øt on his own terms, and his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øation doth not deny it.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:119878:64"/>
               <p>Next he brings in an humble ≈øoul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of his own unworthine≈øs, yet comes re≈øolving to give up him≈øelf to the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ≈øay, An humble ≈øoul will come to his or her Mini≈øter, and profe≈ø≈øe to doe ≈øo; And we wonder he ≈øhould put the ca≈øe of humbled ≈øouls who are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited and encouraged; We here di≈øpute again≈øt him concerning the ob≈øtinately ignorant, ≈øuper≈øtitious Formali≈øts, and the prophane, who for the mo≈øt part ≈øcorn at Reformation and Di≈øcipline; Of ≈øuch we ≈øay they have no right to come till humbled, and profe≈ø≈øe to be ≈øo, nor is't the Mini≈øters duty, but ≈øin to receive them, ≈øpecially ≈øeeing he may prevent it if he will do his duty.</p>
               <p>The Text he u≈øeth further to prove an univer≈øall right to every Ordinance, is <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 66.23. viz. <hi>And it ≈øhall come to pa≈øs that from one new Moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, ≈øhall all fle≈øh come to wor≈øhip before the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Sure this is little for his purpo≈øe; We could an≈øwer, That many eminent Divines do under≈øtand this <hi>New Heavens and Earth</hi> in this Chapter of the <hi>New Hieru≈øalem</hi> in Heaven: But we in≈øi≈øt not
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119878:65"/>upon it: Grant it be meant of wor≈øhip in the Church-Militant; What can be gathered from it but that <hi>All Fle≈øh,</hi> that is, ≈øome of all Nations ≈øhall ≈øubject to Go≈øpel-wor≈øhip, (for we pre≈øume he doth not under≈øtand it of every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall ≈øoul:) But ≈øure it ≈øhall be in Chri≈øts order, ≈øpecially in the later times, when Chri≈øt ≈øhall come as a Refiner of of his wor≈øhip and people, yea, of the ≈øons of <hi>Levi</hi> in a ≈øpeciall manner, that they ≈øhall offer up plea≈øant offerings to the Lord, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. That all ≈øorts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane per≈øons, no evidence of a change, ≈øhall come into the Lords Temple, and prophane the holy things of Chri≈øt, is not in the lea≈øt mea≈øure there meant, but the contrary; fir≈øt orderly received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fellow≈øhip of the Church, and then, if not ≈øcandalous, the ≈øealing Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Supper.</p>
               <p>The ≈øixth Objection he would refell is, <hi>viz. The Sacrament is not a converting Ordinance; we preach to all to convert them, but we may admini≈øter only to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate to confirm them;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this he an≈øwers, <hi>That he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth Divines have u≈øually ≈øo ≈øtated it; Bapti≈øm for Initiation, the Supper for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,

               <p>Pag. 55. <hi>Aye but</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>'tis true of the ≈øame per≈øons, but as for others not yet converted, and humbly coming hither for conver≈øion, there's no Scripture nor rea≈øon to the contrary, but he may be converted by it.</hi>

               <p>We an≈øwer, To come humbly for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion to this Ordinance, ≈øuppo≈øeth conver≈øion begun, and ≈øo that ≈øoul comes for <hi>further</hi> conver≈øion, which is one right u≈øe of this Ordinance; And whereas he ≈øaith, there's no Scripture nor rea≈øon to the contrary; We ≈øay there's both; 'Tis enough the Lord hath made no promi≈øe to it for conver≈øion.</p>

                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> The≈øe were ordained by Chri≈øt to work faith, He hath not proved the Sacrament is ≈øo: Ordinarily <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> Rom. 10.14. and not by <hi>≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:119878:66"/>'Tis not good arguing what Chri≈øt is <hi>able</hi> to do, to what he hath made no promi≈øe to do. And to pro≈øtitute this holy Ordinance upon this account, and ≈øo to go out of Chri≈øts way and method (in reference to what he is <hi>able</hi> or may do) is not warrautable.</p>
               <p>This Argument was devis'd to chear up ≈øuch ≈øouls who are a little affected at the Lords Supper, who know little what conver≈øion means; By this Argument known oppo≈øers of Truth and Purity ought to be invited to come for their conver≈øion.</p>

               <p>But let us examine his Argument, which he cals all the world to an≈øwer, <hi>viz. To ≈øhew forth the death of Chri≈øt is the means of conver≈øion, but the Sacrament is a ≈øhewing forth the death of Chri≈øt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> 'Tis true in the preaching of the Go≈øpel, the ≈øhewing forth of Chri≈øts
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119878:67"/>death is a means of conver≈øion, but not in the Lords Supper, where 'tis only held forth, and ≈øhewed forth to ≈øuppo≈øed Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers; If it be converting in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the Apo≈øtles then did not u≈øe all the means of grace for conver≈øion, They ≈øhould have celebrated the Supper at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sermon, and have bid the people, Come and eat, for here al≈øo the death of Chri≈øt is ≈øhewed forth to convert you, which he will never finde practi≈øed; If he ≈øay, The fir≈øt Churches did every Lords day celebrate the Supper; That was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ≈øuch as were e≈øteemed Saints, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready converted (as all within the Church are ≈øuppo≈øed in a charitable judgement) and in Chri≈øts order; Away with the≈øe Fallacies.</p>
               <p>But this he would prove further from the words of Ju≈øtitution, <hi>Take and eat, [Take for ≈øuch as have not Chri≈øt, and eat for ≈øuch as have already received him.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>An≈ø. A ben√® compo≈øitis ad mal√® divi≈øa;</hi> We take this very un≈øuitable to the parts of the Authour; We pre≈øume a di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction never heard of before; As it hath no appearance of ground, ≈øo we beleeve it not con≈øiderable with the weake≈øt.</p>

               <p>If this had been the ≈øen≈øe, why had not Chri≈øt and the Apo≈øtles ≈øaid to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers <hi>Take,</hi> and to Beleevers <hi>Eat:</hi> This taking, is the putting forth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øing faiuh before wrought; which we ≈øtill ≈øay this Ordinance ≈øuppo≈øeth, till he ≈øhall prove the contrary.</p>
               <p>He puts two or three ca≈øes, <hi>A morall man coming and doing his be≈øt to prepare him≈øelf, and ≈øo comes, Do we think to ≈øuch a man this Ordinance is fruitle≈ø≈øe? Then God help us.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Briefly, The≈øe are not like the acts of a morall man, Examination of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Faith, ≈øuppo≈øeth a beginning of both; And when Mini≈øters call upon morall men to examine them≈øelves in point of Repentance, the Spirit works by it if that ≈øoul really do it; yet we ≈øay, that if all the≈øe be but the acts of a moral man, there's no promi≈øe for his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good by this Ordinance; This is a good Argument to keep his rich Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in peace: <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.15, 16. ≈øhews it an old trade.</p>

                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> We wonder at this ca≈øe, the Que≈øtion being not about ≈øuch, being out of que≈øtion by all, but ≈øuch ought and are invited to come, to receive ≈øtrength and comfort by this Ordinance: ≈øo the two Di≈øciples of <hi>Emmaus,</hi> which he in≈øtanceth in, they were profe≈ø≈øing Di≈øciples, and no que≈øtion, converted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though but weak.</p>

               <p>To this he An≈øwers, <hi>This being unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably granted of our oppo≈øites, the matter is upon the point yielded, All</hi> It may be's, <hi>all occa≈øions mu≈øt be taken for our ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>

                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> When godly men ≈øay a man <hi>may be</hi> converted <hi>at</hi> the Lords Supper, but not <hi>by</hi> it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We conceive they mean ≈øpecially by the Sermon or exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation before it, where all may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent; And if he be then converted, it will be meet for him to ≈øtay till another
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:119878:68"/>opportunity, that he may have a more ≈øpiritual di≈øcerning of that Ordinance: M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Humfreys</hi> knows conver≈øion u≈øually begins with conviction of ≈øinne, and though the ≈øeed of faith may be then ≈øown, yet it acts little at fir≈øt; Chri≈øt not u≈øually giving a view of him≈øelf in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe at the fir≈øt conviction; In ≈øuch a ≈øtrait a poor trembling ≈øoul will ≈øcarce venture to come.</p>
               <p>But granting him as much as he would have, his <hi>It may be,</hi> the point is not therefore yielded as he would per≈øwade his Reader and him≈øelf: The que≈øtion is not, as hath been alledged, What God <hi>can do,</hi> or what <hi>may be,</hi> but of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will of God, and the ordinary way of his di≈øpen≈øation of grace, which mu≈øt be our rule to walk by.</p>
               <p>He would further back this argument with three con≈øiderations, <hi>wholly,</hi> as his confidence leads him, <hi>To root out this ≈øubtlety, which the ≈øpirit of errour hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øinuated.</hi>

               <p>But,<note place="margin">Pag. 59.</note> ≈øaith he, <hi>The Sacraments and all Ordinances are primarily means of grace, it is but in a remote ≈øen≈øe they are means of conver≈øion or confirmation.</hi>

               <p>This is the ≈øub≈øtance of the ≈øecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> He intends by this to prove that if it may occa≈øionally, though not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119878:69"/>convert, then all may come to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p>And whereas he ≈øaith, <hi>The Spirit works by the Sacrament, as by the Word,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119878:70"/>by way of an in≈øtrument:</hi> and ≈øo if the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament do occa≈øionally convert, 'tis enough; It hath been an≈øwered, that this conver≈øion <hi>at</hi> the Sacrament, which ≈øome godly men a≈ø≈øert, is meant, not preci≈øely of the Sacrament, but of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Preaching, Exhortation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Be≈øidcs the word is intentionally, by the reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will of God, an in≈øtrument of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion, and ≈øo an In≈øtitution of Chri≈øt, but this of the Sacrament is not yet, nor we verily beleeve ever will, be proved to be ≈øo.</p>

                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> We need an≈øwer no further to this, he frames a ≈øhadow and fights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt it; He takes that granted to him, which no judicious Divine we know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows him: We ≈øay Prayer is ≈øubordinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converting, but we deny and leave him to prove, <hi>ad graecas Calendas,</hi> that the Sacrament is.

               <p>'Tis the note of a godly minde to urge Scripture to ≈øuch ends for which God ordained them, as this, to pre≈ø≈øe ≈øelf-examination, not as to make void all private reproof, admonition, and di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, contrary to other Scriptures; Wo to the Land if all were of this loo≈øe judgement; Let all people damn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves at plea≈øure by Sacraments, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns no body, neither Mini≈øters nor people.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He di≈øtingui≈øheth between the <hi>Act of receiving and the unworthine≈ø≈øe of it, the Act is good, though the manner be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> So may the Act of murder be ≈øaid to be good, as 'tis an action, or any other vile action, becau≈øe it hath being, and ≈øo good in a Metaphyficall ≈øen≈øe, which we will not puzzle our Reader with, ≈øpeaking chiefly to the deceived people; Know Reader, the Scripture cals it damnable ≈øin, to come unworthily, and be not flattered into ≈øin, by ≈øuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øound niceties; There's no morall good in the coming, God hates thee in thy coming, thou bring'≈øt greater ≈øin upon thy ≈øoul if thou come≈øt unworthily. Ah how are poor ignorant ≈øouls ≈øtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by this rea≈øon? they beleeve there's
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:119878:77"/>
                  <hi>≈øome good,</hi> and they do ≈øome good in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and this makes amends for much prophane≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>He may indeed ≈øay as much for the foule≈øt ≈øin in the world, T he act is good, as it hath being, but the ≈øinne is in the manner; Eating and drinking ≈øimply con≈øidered at the Sacrament is not ≈øin, but ignorance and unworthine≈ø≈øe makes it ≈øo.</p>
               <p>But, ≈øaith he, <hi>There's unworthine≈ø≈øe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Per≈øon if he do not come,</hi> p. 71.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> But not ≈øo great; To be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and come in that unworthine≈ø≈øe to a holy action (which the Word ≈øtiles damnable) is an aggravation of it, and a greater ≈øin, and an abominable moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of God and defiling his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>His ≈øecond Query is, <hi>Whether recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament be otherwi≈øe damnable then hearing and praying, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes is not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Though to pray and hear in a carnall manner be great ≈øins, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthine≈ø≈øe of Receiving is greater; which tho≈øe dreadfull Expre≈ø≈øions in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. do witne≈ø≈øe; be≈øide there lie ab≈øolute commands upon every one to

                  <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> Rev. 13.9. <hi>If any man have an ear to hear let him hear,</hi> Jer. 10.25. The action of receiving is of a more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and holy nature, and the ≈øin of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning it greater: So that if a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane per≈øon refrains to come, he ≈øinnes le≈ø≈øe; though this doth not at all excu≈øe his continuing in prophane≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>But he helps him≈øelf with a di≈øtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby he pretends to ≈øalve all: <hi>There's a pre≈øumptuous prophane way of coming to an Ordinance, or a Chri≈øtian co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in conformity to God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Here's a skinning ≈øoul-flattering plai≈øter for the Enemies of Reformation; It's a ≈øweet bit for the devil to keep up rotten formality: Sir, Doth not he come in a prophane pre≈øumptuous way, who comes but in an outward Conformity? Doth not the mo≈øt prophane wretch do ≈øo? and thinks he doth enough, and covers many ≈øins by it, he will tell you he comes in a conformity to Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip; How many Scriptures might we give him, and we pre≈øume not unknown to him, where the Lord expre≈ø≈øeth his abhorrency of ≈øuch wor≈øhip; See <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 1.11. &amp; 66.5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Chapt.</hi> &amp;c. The people there came before God as his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:119878:78"/>people, in ≈øuch waies of wor≈øhip as he appointed; But they came but in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conformity, therefore (≈øaith the Lord) <hi>'tis an abomination to me, an ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, my ≈øoul hateth it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Therefore this is a di≈øtinction abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Lord; whoever comes in a meer outward conformity, comes in a pre≈øumptuous prophane way.</p>
               <p>His third Query, <hi>Whether an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man conceiving him≈øelf not worthy, mu≈øt never come to the Sacrament,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He an≈øwers, <hi>Herein my thoughts are apt to run comparatively on the word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> An unregenerate per≈øon finding him≈øelf ≈øuch, is not, as ≈øuch, to come, 'twas not ordained for his good; Not to ≈øow the fir≈øt ≈øeed of his new birth, but to ≈øtrengthen it; 2. We deny to be the ≈øame rea≈øon of coming to the Word and Sacrament, for though he hath been and is an unworthy hearer, yet he is to go, becau≈øe the Word preached is ordained for conver≈øion, but not the Sacrament, which is for the Communion of Saints; whereas he ≈øaith, <hi>'tis a means of grace,</hi> 'tis a fallacy, 'tis not a means of the fir≈øt grace.</p>
               <p>He ≈øpeaks in the clo≈øe of a ≈øoul laying
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:119878:78"/>to heart the horrour of his ≈øinne in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of Chri≈øts Bloud, and ≈øo to come.</p>
               <p>This is true, and granted, If he doth lay it to heart, and profe≈ø≈øe to do ≈øo, then the Church doth encourage him to come.</p>
               <p>But we ≈øay, This horrour of his ≈øin is wrought by the preaching of the Word, not by the Act of receiving; And we beleeve a ≈øoul made ≈øen≈øible of this dreadfull guilt in his frequent former co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, will tremble to come at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant, though he is afterwards upon the profe≈ø≈øion of his ≈øin to be encouraged; 'twill not hurt him to lie under the≈øe humblings; yea, if a poor creature ≈øhall doubt of his regeneration, and ≈øo open his condition to the Mini≈øter or the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people, he is to be encouraged if any appearance of regeneration in a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgement be upon him.</p>
               <p>But ≈øaith he: <hi>If coming unworthily makes a man guilty of Chri≈øts bloud, how much more ≈øhall open refu≈øing it, that tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples upon it in this Ordinance?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Briefly, By continuing in ≈øinne and coming to this Ordinance, there's a more abominable trampling under foot
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:119878:79"/>the bloud of Chri≈øt, becau≈øe they make it an unclean thing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in their uncleanne≈ø≈øe, and ≈øo tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling upon and de≈øpi≈øing the ends of Chri≈øts bloud, purity and holine≈ø≈øe; It matters not which is preci≈øely the greater ≈øin, 'tis enough to make a prophane wretch to tremble, that in coming <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily</hi> he becomes guilty of the Lords bloud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So to make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain.</p>
               <p>The ninth Objection again≈øt his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he brings on to an≈øwer, is, <hi>The Ordinance is polluted if all be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He grants it; <hi>To the unworthy Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, to whom all things are unclean, but not to the Admitters unle≈ø≈øe the unworthy are convicted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> But Sir, What if the Mini≈øter and the re≈øt of the Admitters do not their duty to convict an ignorant or a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane per≈øon, but ≈øuffer him to come; When they have power and command from Chri≈øt, as they are a Church, to do ≈øo, is it not then both Mini≈øters and Peoples ≈øin? We dare averre, the Lord will require it of them without their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or el≈øe <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. ≈øtands for a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119878:79"/>blank, and Chri≈øt will never take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it.</p>
               <p>But though this duty be not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, yet they may come fearle≈øly, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>An≈ø. <hi>Satis profan√®,</hi> an expre≈ø≈øion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy a Chri≈øtian (that we may not flatter him) and an abhorring to the Lords people: That a godly ≈øoul ≈øeeing a company of profane wretches, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to godline≈øs (as what Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on abounds not with ≈øuch?) come to this holy my≈øtery, and though he doth not his duty by private admonition and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring their conviction, yet he is no more to be troubled to ≈øee the blood of his Saviour made an unclean thing, then for an unclean cloth.</p>
               <p>Now Reader, thou fee≈øt this Author in his own ≈øhape: His profane Pro≈øelytes ≈øure will ≈øay he hath ≈øtretcht con≈øcience a little too much for them here.</p>

                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> This is the ≈øub≈øtance of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer; We Reply; It hath been already proved by us, that the Jews were kept off from the Sacrifices and Pa≈ø≈øeover, as well for Moral uncleanne≈øs, as Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,<note place="margin">Joh. 9.22. &amp; 12.42. Ezra 10.11.</note> and that the Ceremoniall unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs was a type of the uncleanne≈øs of ≈øin under the Go≈øpel.</p>
               <p>Be≈øides, Was God ≈øo zealous of his wor≈øhip, and the prophaning of it then, that unclean per≈øons were to be cut off, and is there no profaning the holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteries of the Lord Je≈øus now? Nor no care to be taken that unclean per≈øons be not ≈øuffered to defile them? What a cur≈øed pro≈øtitution of the holy things of God is this? But, ≈øaith he,
<q>There is nothing unclean to us now.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Aye but there are things that are too holy for the unclean now, as this holy my≈øtery is.</p>
               <p>But to prove there is nothing unclean now, he urgeth <hi>Ro.</hi> 14.14. <hi>I know I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded there is nothing unclean of it ≈øelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Sir, you know well enough that <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øpeaks there of meats, to the ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the weak Jews, who took ≈øome meats ≈øtill to be accounted unclean under the Go≈øpel; But now he convinceth
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119878:80"/>them ther's nothing, <hi>no meat</hi> to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>unclean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What's this to his purpo≈øe to prove there is no polluting the holy Ordinance of the Lords Supper? unle≈ø≈øe he will make no difference between common meat, and the Lords Supper; which the truth is, his Free Admi≈ø≈øion doth not; This is his argument:</p>
               <p>No meat is now unclean, legall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanne≈øs being taken off, therefore all may come to the Lords Supper; no pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting of it, or at it.</p>
               <p>That of <hi>Peters</hi> vi≈øion is like it; Jews and Gentiles are to have the Go≈øpel preached, therefore no man is defiled by communicating with a wicked per≈øon, though he take no care for the preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him.</p>
               <p>He goes on and urgeth, <hi>Now in the Go≈øpel All's free, we are to have free Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> But, Sir, In Chri≈øts way, The Go≈øpel preached freely to all, but the ≈øeals of it to profe≈ø≈øing Saints.</p>
               <p>He breaks off with a ≈øharp exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the godly Mini≈øters and people, thus; <hi>My Brethren, there are ≈øome touches of the Law and ≈øuper≈øtition on you,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:119878:81"/>you know what a ≈øacred thing was made of the Communion Table when the rayl was about it; Now I pray think how you refine and ≈øpiritualize your old ≈øuper≈øtition, by putting a ≈øpiritual rayl about the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when you debarre poor ≈øinners for coming hither: Let us take heed, there will be ≈øomething of the Phari≈øee in the≈øe ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual proud hearts of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> The Lord rebuke him for this cen≈øorious ≈øarca≈øm; We look upon this di≈øcovery as the ju≈øt hand of God upon him.</p>
               <p>Tis the language of the formall, luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, profane Mini≈øters and people again≈øt the godly party; Oh, ≈øay they, this is their ≈øpiritual pride and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øai≈øme: This pa≈ø≈øage is nuts for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis very ba≈øe (to ≈øay no more) for a Mini≈øter to ca≈øt ≈øuch dirt upon the fair unblemi≈øht memories of ≈øelf-denying Saints, who are now fallen a≈øleep in the Lord; who ≈øuffered deprivations, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhments, impri≈øonments, upon this very ≈øcore chiefly, that they would not admini≈øter Sacraments to all: And now, ≈øaith this Pamphleter, as their per≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors did, 'Twas their ≈øpiritual pride; As they damnd the power of Religion to be

               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> The truth is, he is fitter to be admoni≈øht, to go weep and howl in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate all his daies, for this and other (≈øuch) cur≈øed a≈ø≈øertions, then to have an an≈øwer given to them; were not thou≈øands of ≈øouls even like to peri≈øh and be harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ≈øin by them? Sir, Doth that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous practice of erecting Altars, and railing them about as holy, run parallel with the practice of a con≈øcientious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter, who trembleth that poor ≈øouls ≈øhould eat damnation, and he not labour to prevent it? And as to your rayl, The
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:119878:82"/>Di≈øcipline of Chri≈øts Churches was wont to be ≈øtiled the rayl or fence of them, to pre≈øerve this holy Ordinance from pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: If you get not ≈øuch a rayl Chri≈øt may root out you and your Church (≈øuch as it is) ere you are aware.</p>
               <p>Sir, In≈øtead of this Caveat to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mini≈øters who plead for and practice Reformation in the u≈øe of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; May you tremble at a ≈øpirit of Apo≈øtacy from it, which begins ≈øadly to ≈øteal upon too too many who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly with great zeal contended for it, and that you nor they be not given up of God to greater delu≈øions and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations then the≈øe.</p>
               <p>A little to ≈øalve the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, he brings in the reply of the godly to his former argument, <hi>But are we not faulty and partake of other mens ≈øinnes if we do not our be≈øt to have the leaven purged out,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Is not this to grant in effect what we contend for, That 'tis every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants ≈øin if he do not admoni≈øh a per≈øon coming prophanely to this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and he becomes guilty if he neglect it?

               <p>He limits the duty of <hi>telling the Church,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>If the Church be in a capacity to hear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then 'tis granted the Church ought to be in a <hi>capacity</hi> to hear: If he means by this capacity, A Church enjoying all Officers, who≈øe fault is it that you have them not?

If they be not fit to choo≈øe they are not fit for Sacraments, as hath been ≈øhewed, we mean as to a good part of them; but we conceive the Church it ≈øelf, as di≈øtingui≈øht from its

                  <hi>Humfreys</hi> by his <hi>mean while,</hi> implies that in an exigency there ought to be Free Admi≈ø≈øion, rather then no Sacraments: Though we conceive that doth not ab≈øolutely take away the guilt, yet we could wi≈øh that he had ≈øo ≈øtated the que≈øtion, and not to pre≈øs his Free Admi≈ø≈øion <hi>ab≈øolutely</hi> upon Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters and people, and that 'tis their ≈øin not to allow it.</p>
               <p>But, ≈øaith he, <hi>The neglect of this duty of admonition, is the ≈øin by it ≈øelf, the coming is our duty.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Here is a fine nicety to skin over a ≈øin: Sir, If a Godly man do not admoni≈øh a wicked man coming, that ≈øo he may profe≈øs his repentance to the Church, or be kept off, ≈øuch a one comes to the Sacrament with guilt upon him, for he hath not performed a concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant duty in coming; and ≈øo his want of admonition is a ≈øin in reference to his coming.</p>
               <p>Aye but ≈øaith he, <hi>Becau≈øe the leaven

               <p>Yea, but ≈øuch a lump as is totally lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened and defiled for want of this duty, and therefore ought to become a new lump, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.</p>
               <p>The next reply brought again≈øt his argument is, <hi>Are not all ignorant and ≈øcandalous per≈øons ≈øwine and dogs, to be rejected, and ≈øo kept off from pearls,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He an≈øwers, I dare not ≈øay, though I ≈øee what intere≈øt lies at ≈øtake, which may ≈øoon fancy a Chri≈øtian conveniency into a divine nece≈ø≈øity.</p>

               <p>And Sir, 'tis not only Chri≈øtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to keep off ≈øuch, but a <hi>po≈øitive command</hi> of Chri≈øt in that Scripture. To his five rea≈øons,</p>

               <p>Now we humbly conceive what this Reverend Authour ≈øaith of a General Councel, is in this ca≈øe applicable to Magi≈øtrates; As the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia</hi> were not to ≈øtay for a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, as to the Reforming their Churches, ≈øo neither for an Edict from the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate; The Lord will require the blood of ≈øuch as peri≈øh for want of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at <hi>our</hi> hands.

               <p>Now ≈øay ≈øome, If the Magi≈øtrate would give us authority, we would ≈øet about this practice; Sure this will not ≈øerve the turn before the bar of the Lord, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it may quiet con≈øcience for a time.

               <p>So of <hi>John</hi> 2.10, 11. Sure he will not have ≈øuch as deny the doctrine of Chri≈øt to be continued in the Church, and come

               <p>As for <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.24, 25. viz. <hi>Make no friend≈øhip with an angry man,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>For Separations in the vi≈øible Church which he ≈øugge≈øts dangerous, We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, That if as much and great profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe and abominations ≈øhall be fouled with the vi≈øible Church (as is too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent) as even among ≈øuch know not God, Then Separations as to the holy things of God, where holy men have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly right, is ju≈øtifiable in the eyes of God, Saints and Angels.</p>
               <p>For his ≈øugge≈øted danger of ≈øeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon ≈øeparation; 1. We an≈øwer, That how is there <hi>properly</hi> a Separation, when there hath been no true uniting, nor hath one per≈øon con≈øidered him≈øelf to have any more relation to another, then as one of their Pari≈øh, but hear one another lie, ≈øwear, and commit together, and rather encourage then reprove one another for it; Separation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

               <p>What if Excommunication be ≈øet up by a Law from men in every Pari≈øh, (which we beleeve to be impo≈ø≈øible to any purpo≈øe, as the ca≈øe ≈øtands with mo≈øt Mini≈øters and People who are bitterly again≈øt it) and there ≈øhould 50 lyars, ≈øwearers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be ca≈øt out, would not there lie the ≈øame Objection again≈øt this practi≈øe al≈øo? And yet the Author makes us beleeve he would have Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ≈øet up.</p>
               <p>Now when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>Now we crave of our Brethren of the Mini≈øtery, and the people we preach to, and others, to con≈øider, that the≈øe are the duties we call upon for to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, and that people that fear the Lord might ≈øubmit con≈øcionably to the practi≈øe of them; We crave of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
